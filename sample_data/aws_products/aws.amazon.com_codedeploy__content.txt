Benefits
Automated deployments
AWS CodeDeploy fully automates your software deployments, allowing you to deploy reliably and rapidly. You can consistently deploy your application across your development, test, and production environments whether deploying to Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, or your on-premises servers. The service scales with your infrastructure.
Minimize downtime
AWS CodeDeploy helps maximize your application availability during the software deployment process. It introduces changes incrementally and tracks application health according to configurable rules. Software deployments can easily be stopped and rolled back if there are errors.
Centralized control
AWS CodeDeploy allows you to easily launch and track the status of your application deployments through the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. CodeDeploy gives you a detailed report allowing you to view when and to where each application revision was deployed. You can also create push notifications to receive live updates about your deployments.
Easy to adopt
AWS CodeDeploy is platform and language agnostic, works with any application, and provides the same experience whether youâ€™re deploying to Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, or AWS Lambda. You can easily reuse your existing setup code. CodeDeploy can also integrate with your existing software release process or continuous delivery toolchain (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub, Jenkins).
