Amazon Elastic Container Service
Highly secure, reliable, and scalable way to run containers
Get started with Amazon ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere.
Amazon ECS leverages serverless technology from AWS Fargate to deliver autonomous container operations, which reduces the time spent on configuration, patching, and security. Instead of worrying about managing the control plane, add-ons, and nodes, Amazon ECS enables you to rapidly build applications and grow your business.
Amazon ECS: Core Concepts
Benefits
Use your existing tools
No control plane or nodes to manage
Lower your compute costs
Meet security and regulatory requirements
Amazon ECS is the easiest way to rapidly launch thousands of containers across AWS’ broad range of compute options, using your preferred CI/CD and automation tools.
Amazon ECS is serverless by default with AWS Fargate, which means you’ll spend less time on operations because there’s no control plane or nodes to manage, and no instances to patch and scale.
You only pay for the resources you configure. Amazon ECS can autonomously handle the provisioning and auto-scaling, which can help lower your compute costs by up to 50%.
Amazon ECS integrates natively with AWS management and governance solutions to meet the security and compliance standards for virtually every regulatory agency around the globe.
