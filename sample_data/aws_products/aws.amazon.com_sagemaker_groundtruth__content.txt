Amazon SageMaker provides two data labeling offerings, Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Both options allow you to identify raw data, such as images, text files, and videos, and add informative labels to create high-quality training datasets for your machine learning models.
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus
With SageMaker Ground Truth Plus, you can easily create high-quality training datasets without having to build labeling applications or manage labeling workforces on your own. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus helps reduce data labeling costs by up to 40%. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus provides an expert workforce that is trained on ML tasks, and can help meet your data security, privacy, and compliance requirements. You simply upload your data, and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus then creates data labeling workflows and manages workflows on your behalf.
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
If you want the flexibility to build and manage your data labeling workflows and manage your own data labeling workforce, you can use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. SageMaker Ground Truth is a data labeling service that makes it easy to label data and gives you the option to use human annotators through Amazon Mechanical Turk, third-party vendors, or your own private workforce.

Benefits
Improve quality of training datasets
Amazon SageMaker data labeling offerings provide ML labeling techniques that are less prone to manual errors and help improve the quality of training datasets. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus has a multi-step labeling workflow that includes ML models for pre-labeling, machine validation of human labeling to detect errors and low-quality labels, and assistive labeling features (e.g., 3D cuboid snapping, predict-next in video labeling, and auto-segment tools). If you are managing your own data labeling workflows, SageMaker Ground Truth provides automated labeling features such as auto-segment, automatic 3D cuboid snapping, and sensor fusion with 2D video frames.  In addition, SageMaker Ground Truth provides automatic data labeling which uses active learning and only routes labeled data to humans it the model cannot confidently label it.
Choose your data labeling workforce
With Amazon SageMaker data labeling offerings, you can choose your data labeling workforce. With SageMaker Ground Truth Plus, an expert workforce that is trained on ML tasks labels your data in accordance with your quality and turnaround time requirements. With SageMaker Ground Truth, you have options to work with labelers inside and outside of your organization. You can easily send labeling jobs to your own labelers, or you can access a workforce of over 500,000 independent contractors who are already performing ML-related tasks through Amazon Mechanical Turk. If your data requires confidentiality or special skills, you can also use vendors that are pre-screened by AWS for quality and security procedures.
Increase visibility of data labeling operations
Amazon SageMaker data labeling offerings enable you to gain transparency into data labeling operations and quality management so you can verify that your quality requirements are being met. SageMaker Ground Truth Plus provides interactive dashboards and user interfaces, so you can monitor progress of training datasets across multiple projects, track project metrics such as daily throughput, inspect labels for quality, and provide feedback on the labeled data.
Receive high-quality labeled data quickly
With Amazon SageMaker data labeling offerings, you can receive high-quality labeled data quickly. With SageMaker Ground Truth Plus, you simply upload your data in Amazon S3 along with security, privacy, and compliance requirements. AWS experts will then setup the data labeling workflow and an expert workforce will complete your labeling tasks.
