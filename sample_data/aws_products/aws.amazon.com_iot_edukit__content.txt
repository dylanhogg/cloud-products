Get hands-on with IoT
AWS IoT EduKit makes it easy for developers—from students to experienced professionals—to receive hands-on experience building end-to-end IoT applications by combining a reference hardware kit with a set of easy to follow educational tutorials and example code.
Introduction to AWS IoT EduKit
Simplified hardware selection
AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware kit (made and sold by our manufacturing partner, M5Stack) is packed with on-board features to enable a multitude of IoT applications out of the box. Developers can broaden their capabilities to cover additional use cases with hundreds of plug-and-play expansion options.
A wide range of software frameworks
AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware supports a wide range of application frameworks (e.g. FreeRTOS, Arduino, MicroPython), which allows developers to code in the language of their choice and progress in building cloud connected embedded applications on a single hardware platform.
Easy access to sample code
AWS IoT EduKit provides up-to-date content and example code to common IoT solutions. Through AWS IoT EduKit tutorials, developers can access a variety of free content to gain expertise in building and managing IoT applications using AWS services.
