Reduce costs, improve performance, improve security
Get Started with AWS Trusted Advisor
Step by Step Guide
AWS Trusted Advisors provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow the check recommendations to optimize your services and resources.
AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can access core security checks and all checks for service quotas. AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers can access all checks, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service quotas. For a complete list of checks and descriptions, see the Trusted Advisor Best Practices.

Benefits
Checks from Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS environment and recommends best practices.
Cost optimization
Trusted Advisor can help you save cost, such as recommending you to delete unused or idle resources, or use reserved capacity.
Performance
Trusted Advisor can improve the performance of your services by ensuring you to take advantage of provisioned throughput, and monitoring for overutilized Amazon EC2 instances.
Security
Trusted Advisor can improve the security of your application by recommending you to enable AWS security features, and review your permissions.
Fault tolerance
Trusted Advisor can increase the availability of your AWS application by recommending you  to take advantage of auto scaling, health checks, multi-AZ Regions, and backup capabilities.
Service quotas
Service quotas, also referred to as Service limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations that apply to an account or a Region. Trusted Advisor can notify you if you use more than 80% of a service quota. You can then follow recommendations to delete resources or request a quota increase. Check results are based on a snapshot, so your current usage might vary.
