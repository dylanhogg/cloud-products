AWS Step Functions
Visual workflows for modern applications
Get Started for Free
AWS Step Functions is a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. Workflows manage failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability so developers can focus on higher-value business logic.
Build workflows with 200+ AWS services and 9,000 API actions

Benefits
Build and deploy rapidly
Get started quickly with Workflow Studio, a simple drag-and-drop interface. With Step Functions, you can express complex business logic as low-code, event-driven workflows that connect services, systems or people within minutes.
Write less integration code
Compose AWS resources from over 200 services including Lambda, ECS, Fargate, Batch, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, SageMaker, EventBridge, or EMR into resilient business workflows, data pipelines, or applications.
Build fault-tolerant and stateful workflows
Step Functions manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you to make sure that your workflows run in order and as expected. Built-in try/catch, retry, and rollback capabilities deal with errors and exceptions automatically based on your defined business logic.
Designed for reliability and scale
Step Functions offers two workflow types - Standard or Express - that can be used depending on your specific use case.  Standard Workflows are used to manage long-running workloads.  Express Workflows support high-volume event processing workloads.

Use cases
Automate Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process
Ensure that long-running, multiple ETL jobs run in order and complete successfully, instead of manually orchestrating those jobs or maintaining a separate application.
Prepare Data for Machine Learning (ML)
To enable machine learning, source data must be collected, processed, and normalized so that ML modelling systems like Amazon SageMaker can train on that data. Step Functions makes it easier to sequence the steps it takes to automate your ML pipeline.
Orchestrate microservices
Use Step Functions to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications and microservices. You can also orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers
Liberty Mutual
Liberty Mutual created an event-driven workflow with Step Functions in which the data feeds from each line of business are transformed into a series of events, or financial transactions. Learn how they are processed one million transactions monthly for just $60.00.

Freebird
Use Step Functions to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications and microservices, without having to write code for workflow logic, parallel processes, error handling, timeouts, or retries. You can also orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers.
