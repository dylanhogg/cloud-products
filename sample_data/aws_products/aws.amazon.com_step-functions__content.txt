AWS Step Functions
Assemble functions into business-critical applications
Sign in to the console
AWS Step Functions is a serverless function orchestrator that makes it easy to sequence AWS Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications. Through its visual interface, you can create and run a series of checkpointed and event-driven workflows that maintain the application state. The output of one step acts as an input to the next. Each step in your application executes in order, as defined by your business logic.
Orchestrating a series of individual serverless applications, managing retries, and debugging failures can be challenging. As your distributed applications become more complex, the complexity of managing them also grows. With its built-in operational controls, Step Functions manages sequencing, error handling, retry logic, and state, removing a significant operational burden from your team.

Benefits
Build and update apps quickly
AWS Step Functions lets you build visual workflows that enable fast translation of business requirements into technical requirements. You can build applications in a matter of minutes, and when needs change, you can swap or reorganize components without customizing any code.
Improve resiliency
AWS Step Functions manages state, checkpoints and restarts for you to make sure that your application executes in order and as expected. Built-in try/catch, retry and rollback capabilities deal with errors and exceptions automatically.
Write less code
AWS Step Functions manages the logic of your application for you, and implements basic primitives such as branching, parallel execution, and timeouts. This removes extra code that may be repeated in your microservices and functions.

Use cases
Data processing
Step Functions can help ensure that long-running, multiple ETL jobs execute in order and complete successfully, instead of manually orchestrating those jobs or maintaining a separate application. You can also use Step Functions to standardize a machine learning training workflow to improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
Automate tasks
Step Functions provides auditable automation of routine deployments, upgrades, installations, and migrations. You can use Step Functions to easily automate recurring tasks such as patch management, infrastructure selection, and data synchronization, and Step Functions will automatically scale, respond to timeouts, and retry failed tasks.
Modernize a monolith
By using Step Functions to carve off a few tasks from the rest of your codebase, you can tackle the transformation of monolithic applications into microservices as a series of small steps. This allows you to untangle business-critical code safely and at your own pace, without disrupting operations and while you continue to deliver new features.
Application orchestration
Use Step Functions to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications and microservices, without having to write code for workflow logic, parallel processes, error handling, timeouts or retries. You can also orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers.
