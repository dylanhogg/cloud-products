How it works
Amazon Lookout for Vision is an ML service that uses computer vision to spot defects in manufactured products at scale.
Use cases
Detect part damage
Spot damage to a product’s surface quality, color, and shape during the fabrication and assembly process.
Identify missing components
Determine what’s missing based on the absence, presence, or placement of objects, like a missing capacitor in a printed circuit board.
Uncover process issues
Detect defects with repeating patterns, such as repeated scratches in the same spot on a silicon wafer.
