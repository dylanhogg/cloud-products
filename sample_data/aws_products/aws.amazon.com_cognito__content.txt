Secure and scalable identity store
Amazon Cognito User Pools provide a secure identity store that scales to millions of users. Cognito User Pools can be more easily set up without provisioning any infrastructure, and all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can manage through a Software Development Kit (SDK).

Access control for AWS resources
Amazon Cognito provides solutions to control access to AWS resources from your app. You can define roles and map users to different roles so your app can access only the resources that are authorized for each user. Alternatively, you can use attributes from identity providers in AWS Identity and Access Management permission policies, so you can control access to resources to users who meet specific attribute conditions.

Sign in users and get back tokens using the SDKs and a few lines of code.

Trusted by developers
Pay only for what you use. No minimums.
If you are using Amazon Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only. A user is counted as a MAU if, within a calendar month, there is an identity operation related to that user, such as sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, password change, or a user account attribute is updated. You are not charged for subsequent sessions or for inactive users within that calendar month.
