Trusted by developers
Pay only for what you use. No minimums.
If you are using Amazon Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only. A user is counted as a MAU if, within a calendar month, there is an identity operation related to that user, such as sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, or password change. You are not charged for subsequent sessions or for inactive users within that calendar month.
