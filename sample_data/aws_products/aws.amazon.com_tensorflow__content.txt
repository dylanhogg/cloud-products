TensorFlow on AWS
Deep learning in the cloud made simple.
Try Amazon SageMaker
TensorFlow™ enables developers to quickly and easily get started with deep learning in the cloud. The framework has broad support in the industry and has become a popular choice for deep learning research and application development, particularly in areas such as computer vision, natural language understanding and speech translation.
You can get started on AWS with a fully-managed TensorFlow experience with Amazon SageMaker, a platform to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. Or, you can use the AWS Deep Learning AMIs to build custom environments and workflows with TensorFlow and other popular frameworks including Apache MXNet, PyTorch, Caffe, Caffe2, Chainer, Gluon, Keras, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.
85% of TensorFlow projects in the cloud happen on AWS.
