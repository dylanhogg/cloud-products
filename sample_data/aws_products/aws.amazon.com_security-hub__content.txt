How it works
AWS Security Hub is a cloud security posture management service that performs security best practice checks, aggregates alerts, and enables automated remediation.
Use cases
Conduct Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Reduce your risk with automated checks based on a collection of security controls curated by experts and simplify compliance management with built in mapping capabilities for common frameworks like CIS, PCI DSS, and more.
Initiate Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) workflows
Automatically enrich findings, remediate them, or send them to ticketing systems with Security Hub’s integration with EventBridge.
Save time and money by simplifying integrations
Simplify and streamline data ingestion into your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), ticketing, and other tools by consolidating the integrations between AWS services and your downstream tooling and by normalizing your findings.
Correlate your security findings to discover new insights
