Organizations choose to build APIs with GraphQL because it helps them develop applications faster, by giving front-end developers the ability to query multiple databases, microservices, and APIs with a single GraphQL endpoint.  AWS AppSync is a fully managed service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to data sources like AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and more. Adding caches to improve performance, subscriptions to support real-time updates, and client-side data stores that keep off-line clients in sync are just as easy. Once deployed, AWS AppSync automatically scales your GraphQL API execution engine up and down to meet API request volumes.

Benefits
Simple & secure data access
Power your applications with the right data, from one or more data sources with a single network request using GraphQL. AWS AppSync makes it easy to secure your app data using multiple concurrent authentication modes and allows you to define security, caching and fine-grained access control at the data definition level directly from your GraphQL schema.
Built-in real-time & offline capabilities
With managed GraphQL subscriptions, AWS AppSync can push real-time data updates over Websockets to millions of clients. For mobile and web applications, AppSync also provides local data access when devices go offline, and data synchronization with customizable conflict resolution, when they are back online.
No servers to manage
AWS AppSync offers fully managed GraphQL API setup, administration, and maintenance, with high-availability serverless infrastructure built in. Create a GraphQL API in seconds via the AWS CLI, console, Amplify CLI or CloudFormation. And, easily monitor and acquire insights via CloudWatch and X-Ray for flawless operation.
How it works
GraphQL APIs built with AWS AppSync give front-end developers the ability to query multiple databases, microservices, and APIs from a single GraphQL endpoint.
Use cases
Real-time collaboration
Real-time chat application
Real-time IoT dashboard
Unified microservices access
Unified data access
Offline application sync
Broadcast data from the backend to all connected clients (one-to-many) or between clients (many-to-many), such as in a second screen scenario where you broadcast the same data to all clients, who can then reply.
Additional resources: Tutorial
Build conversational mobile or web applications that support multiple private chat rooms, offer access to conversation history, and queue outbound messages, even when a device is offline.
Access IoT device data sent to AWS IoT to build real-time dashboards in a mobile or web application that visualizes telemetry from a connected IoT device, like a car.
Access and combine data from multiple microservices running in containers in a VPC, behind a REST API endpoint, a GraphQL API endpoint, and more, in a single interface.
Sample code examples: Airline, E-Commerce
Retrieve or modify data from multiple data sources (SQL, NoSQL, search data, REST endpoints, and serverless backends) with a single call. Query and create relations between data sources using GraphQL connections.
Automatically synchronize data between mobile/web applications and the cloud with AWS AppSync and Amplify DataStore, an on-device persistent storage engine with built-in support for data versioning and conflict detection and resolution.
