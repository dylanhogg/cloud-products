Amazon Timestream
Fast, scalable, serverless time series database
Get Started with Amazon Timestream
Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day up to 1,000 times faster and at as little as 1/10th the cost of relational databases. Amazon Timestream saves you time and cost in managing the lifecycle of time series data by keeping recent data in memory and moving historical data to a cost optimized storage tier based upon user defined policies. Amazon Timestream’s purpose-built query engine lets you access and analyze recent and historical data together, without needing to specify explicitly in the query whether the data resides in the in-memory or cost-optimized tier. Amazon Timestream has built-in time series analytics functions, helping you identify trends and patterns in your data in near real-time. Amazon Timestream is serverless and automatically scales up or down to adjust capacity and performance, so you don’t need to manage the underlying infrastructure, freeing you to focus on building your applications.
Introduction to Amazon Timestream
Benefits
High performance at low cost
Amazon Timestream is designed to enable interactive and affordable real-time analytics, with up to 1,000 times faster query performance, and as little as 1/10th the cost of relational databases. With product features such as scheduled queries, multi-measure records, and data storage tiering, you can process, store, and analyze your time-series data at a fraction of the cost of existing time-series solutions. Amazon Timestream can help you derive faster and more affordable insights from your data so you can continue to make more data driven business decisions.
Serverless with auto-scaling
Amazon Timestream is serverless – there are no servers to manage and no capacity to provision, so you can focus on building your applications. Amazon Timestream gives you the scale to process trillions of events and millions of queries per day. As your application needs change, it automatically scales to adjust capacity.
Data lifecycle management
Amazon Timestream simplifies the complex process of data lifecycle management. It offers storage tiering, with a memory store for recent data and a magnetic store for historical data. Amazon Timestream automates the transfer of data from the memory store to the magnetic store based upon user configurable policies.
Simplified data access
With Amazon Timestream, you no longer need to use disparate tools to access recent and historical data. Amazon Timestream's purpose-built query engine transparently accesses and combines data across storage tiers without you having to specify the data location.
Purpose-built for time series
You can quickly analyze time series data using SQL, with built-in time series functions for smoothing, approximation, and interpolation. Amazon Timestream also supports advanced aggregates, window functions, and complex data types such as arrays and rows.
Always encrypted
Amazon Timestream ensures that your time series data is always encrypted, whether at rest or in transit. Amazon Timestream also enables you to specify an AWS KMS customer managed key (CMK) for encrypting data in the magnetic store.
Use cases
IoT applications
Amazon Timestream makes it possible for you to quickly analyze time series data generated by IoT applications using built-in analytic functions such as such as smoothing, approximation, and interpolation. For example, a smart home device manufacturer can use Amazon Timestream to collect motion or temperature data from the device sensors, interpolate to identify the time ranges without motion, and alert consumers to take actions such as turning down the heat to save energy.
DevOps applications
Amazon Timestream is ideal for DevOps solutions that monitor health and usage metrics and analyze data in real-time to improve performance and availability. For example, with Amazon Timestream, you can collect and analyze operational metrics such as CPU/memory utilization, network data, and IOPS to monitor health and optimize instance usage.
Analytics applications
Amazon Timestream enables you to easily store and analyze data at scale. For example, with clickstream data, you can use Amazon Timestream to store and process the incoming and outgoing web traffic for your applications. Amazon Timestream also provides aggregate functions to analyze this data and get insights such as path-to-purchase and shopping cart abandonment rate.
Customers
Autodesk is a global leader in software for architecture, engineering, construction, media and entertainment, and manufacturing industries.
“At Autodesk, we make software for people who make things. This includes everything from buildings, bridges, roads, cars, medical devices, and consumer electronics, to the movies and video games that we all know and love. We see that Amazon Timestream has the potential to help deliver new workflows by providing a cloud-hosted, scalable time-series database. We anticipate that this will improve product performance and reduce waste in manufacturing. The key differentiator that excites us is the promise that this value will come without adding a data management burden for the customers nor Autodesk.”
Scott Reese, SVP of Manufacturing, Cloud, and Production Products – Autodesk.
PubNub's Realtime Communication Platform processes trillions of messages per month on behalf of thousands of customers and millions of end users.
“To effectively operate the PubNub platform, it is essential to monitor the enormous number of high-cardinality metrics that this traffic generates. As our traffic volumes and the number of tracked metrics have grown over time, the challenges of scaling our self-managed monitoring solution have grown as well, and it is prohibitively expensive for us to use a SaaS monitoring solution for this data. Amazon Timestream has helped address both of these needs perfectly. We’ve been working with AWS as a Timestream preview customer, providing feedback throughout the preview process. AWS has built an amazing product in Timestream, in part by incorporating PubNub's feedback. We truly appreciate the fully-managed and autoscaling aspects that we have come to expect of AWS services, and we're thrilled that we can use Grafana with Amazon Timestream to visualize our time-series data."
Dan Genzale, Director of Operations – PubNub
Trimble Inc., is a leading technology provider of productivity solutions for the construction, resources, geospatial, and transportation industries.
“Whenever possible, the Trimble Cloud Platform team tries to leverage AWS’ managed service offerings. We are excited to now use Amazon Timestream as a serverless time series database supporting our IoT monitoring solution. Timestream is purpose-built for our IoT-generated time series data, and will allow us to reduce management overhead, improve performance, and reduce cost for our existing monitoring system.”
David Kohler, Engineering Director – Trimble
Cake is a performance marketing software company that stores and analyzes billions of clickstream events.
"Previously, we used a DIY time series solution that was cumbersome to manage and was starting to fall over at scale. When we heard AWS was building a time series database service, Amazon Timestream, we signed up for the preview and started testing our workloads. We’ve worked very closely with the AWS service team, giving them feedback and data on our use case to help ensure Timestream really excels in production for the size and scale of time series data we’re dealing with. And the result is phenomenal – a highly scalable and fully serverless database. It’s the first time we’ve had a single solution for our time series data. We’re looking forward to continuing our partnership with AWS and excited to see what’s in store for Timestream."
