Download O3DE 21.11
In July, we announced the formation of the Open 3D Foundation and the Open 3D Engine (O3DE), a AAA-capable, cross-platform, open-source game engine available under an Apache 2.0 license. We wanted to give game and simulation developers more choices to collaborate, customize, and control their production pipelines. We're also growing an open-source community with the Linux Foundation and industry partners. The successor to Lumberyard, the O3DE Stable 21.11 Release is now available, with a new Windows installer and support for Linux.

Announcing Open 3D Engine (O3DE)
Benefits
Build bigger
O3DE is architected for modularity and flexibility. Swap out subsystems or easily add integrations to give your games and simulations the capabilities they need without the features they don’t.
Build connected
Add multiplayer scaling, analytics, cloud storage, and real-time data sources to your game directly from the engine with O3DE’s AWS Integration Gem.
Build free
O3DE is free and includes full source. There are no seat fees, subscription fees, or requirements to share revenue. Licensed under Apache 2.0, you have complete control of your engine technology.

We also make games: Our first AWS O3DE game is now available
Developers like code. Developers like demos. But game developers, in our experience, REALLY like code and demos. And we’re looking to share some code and demos with you. After all, when you’re starting to create a new game, it can help you when you can see something working, and explore “how they did it.” Read the blog
