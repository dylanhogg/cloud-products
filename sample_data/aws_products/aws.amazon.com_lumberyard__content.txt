Amazon Lumberyard
Now in Developer Preview – Open 3D Engine
As we began building the successor to Lumberyard, we wanted to give developers the ability to access technology, contribute, and grow it. With that comes the Linux Foundation and their Open 3D Foundation, with AWS seeding the foundation with the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) – a AAA-capable, cross platform open source game engine available under an Apache 2.0 license.
