AWS Lake Formation
Build a secure data lake in days
Get started with AWS Lake Formation
AWS Lake Formation is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.
However, setting up and managing data lakes today involves a lot of manual, complicated, and time-consuming tasks. This work includes loading data from diverse sources, monitoring those data flows, setting up partitions, turning on encryption and managing keys, defining transformation jobs and monitoring their operation, re-organizing data into a columnar format, configuring access control settings, deduplicating redundant data, matching linked records, granting access to data sets, and auditing access over time.
Creating a data lake with Lake Formation is as simple as defining data sources and what data access and security policies you want to apply. Lake Formation then helps you collect and catalog data from databases and object storage, move the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake, clean and classify your data using machine learning algorithms, and secure access to your sensitive data. Your users can access a centralized data catalog which describes available data sets and their appropriate usage. Your users then leverage these data sets with their choice of analytics and machine learning services, like Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and (in beta) Amazon EMR for Apache Spark. Lake Formation builds on the capabilities available in AWS Glue.

Benefits
Build data lakes quickly
With Lake Formation, you can move, store, catalog, and clean your data faster. You simply point Lake Formation at your data sources, and Lake Formation crawls those sources and moves the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake. Lake Formation organizes data in S3 around frequently used query terms and into right-sized chunks to increase efficiency. Lake Formation also changes data into formats like Apache Parquet and ORC for faster analytics. In addition, Lake Formation has built-in machine learning to deduplicate and find matching records (two entries that refer to the same thing) to increase data quality.
Simplify security management
You can use Lake Formation to centrally define security, governance, and auditing policies in one place, versus doing these tasks per service, and then enforce those policies for your users across their analytics applications. Your policies are consistently implemented, eliminating the need to manually configure them across security services like AWS Identity and Access Management and AWS Key Management Service, storage services like S3, and analytics and machine learning services like Redshift, Athena, and (in beta) EMR for Apache Spark. This reduces the effort in configuring policies across services and provides consistent enforcement and compliance.
Provide self-service access to data
With Lake Formation you build a data catalog that describes the different data sets that are available along with which groups of users have access to each. This makes your users more productive by helping them find the right data set to analyze. By providing a catalog of your data with consistent security enforcement, Lake Formation makes it easier for your analysts and data scientists to use their preferred analytics service. They can use EMR for Apache Spark (in beta), Redshift, or Athena on diverse data sets now housed in a single data lake. Users can also combine these services without having to move data between silos.
How it works
Lake Formation helps to build, secure, and manage your data lake. First, identify existing data stores in S3 or relational and NoSQL databases, and move the data into your data lake. Then crawl, catalog, and prepare the data for analytics. Then provide your users secure self-service access to the data through their choice of analytics services. Other AWS services and third-party applications can also access data through the services shown. Lake Formation manages all of the tasks in the orange box and is integrated with the data stores and services shown in the blue boxes.

Customers
Nu Skin Enterprises is a global direct selling company that distributes more than 200 premium-quality anti-aging products in both the personal care and nutritional supplements categories.
"We were challenged with expanding capability and scaling throughput of our existing analytics systems. Our data was distributed amongst various disconnected databases and SaaS solutions, making it difficult to analyze data at scale while restricting access to sensitive data. To overcome this challenge, we built a data lake solution on AWS. This allowed us to aggregate data from various data silos into Amazon S3 where we cataloged and secured all data using AWS Lake Formation. Without AWS Lake Formation, it would have been impossible to achieve the goal of a scalable, easy to use security layer for all data on Amazon S3. It was easy to set up and apply fine-grained access controls based on user personas."
Joe Sueper, VP Enterprise Architecture, Global Technology - Nu Skin Enterprises
Panasonic Avionics Corporation is the world's leading supplier of in-flight entertainment and communication systems.
“We wanted to create a data platform with the ability to manage the security settings for all the different applications in our environment. With AWS Lake Formation, we can now define policies once and enforce them in the same way, everywhere, for multiple services we use, including AWS Glue and Amazon Athena. The enhanced level of control gives us secure access to data and meta-data for columns and tables, not just for bulk objects, which is an important part of our data security and governance standard.”
Anand Desikan, Director of Cloud and Data Services - Panasonic Avionics
Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations.
“I focus on helping clients in their ‘Data on Cloud’ journey. Specific to that, we have seen that organizations are dealing with a lack of trusted data when they need to perform analytics on data coming from multiple sources. Data cleansing is a critical step in data analytics and can greatly impact the business outcome and decision making. The new features in AWS Lake Formation have been hugely beneficial to address the challenge of data veracity and securing access to the data lake. We found it tremendously useful to make use of the advanced machine learning techniques for data preparation to find matching records, clean, and deduplicate data from different data sources. This will help reduce the time, effort, and cost, while improving the quality and accuracy of the data in a customer’s data lakes.”
Namrata Maheshwary, Senior Architect for the Data Business Group - Accenture
