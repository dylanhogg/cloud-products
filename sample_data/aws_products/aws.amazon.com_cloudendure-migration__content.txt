AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) allows you to quickly realize the benefits of migrating applications to the cloud without changes and with minimal downtime.
AWS Application Migration Service minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automatically converting your source servers from physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS. It further simplifies your migration by enabling you to use the same automated process for a wide range of applications.
And by launching non-disruptive tests before migrating, you can be confident that your most critical applications such as SAP, Oracle, and SQL Server will work seamlessly on AWS.
When to use AWS Application Migration Service
AWS Application Migration Service is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS. Customers currently using CloudEndure Migration or Server Migration Service (SMS) are encouraged to switch to AWS Application Migration Service for future migrations. Learn more

Benefits
Access to advanced technology
Simplify operations and get better insights with AWS Application Migration Service’s integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and other AWS services.
Minimal downtime during migration
With AWS Application Migration Service, you can maintain normal business operations throughout the replication process. It continuously replicates source servers, which means little to no performance impact. Continuous replication also makes it easy to conduct non-disruptive tests and shortens cutover windows.
Reduced costs
AWS Application Migration Service reduces overall migration costs as there is no need to invest in multiple migration solutions, specialized cloud development, or application-specific skills. This is because it can be used to migrate any application from any source infrastructure that runs supported operating systems (OS).
How it works
Agent Installation Implementation begins by installing the AWS Replication Agent on your source servers. Once it’s installed, you can view and define replication settings. AWS Application Migration Service uses these settings to create and manage a Staging Area Subnet with lightweight Amazon EC2 instances that act as Replication Servers and low-cost staging Amazon EBS volumes.
Continuous Replication Replication Servers receive data from the agent running on your source servers and write this data to the staging Amazon EBS volumes. Your replicated data is compressed and encrypted in transit, and can be encrypted at rest using EBS encryption. AWS Application Migration Service keeps your source servers up to date on AWS using continuous, block-level data replication. It uses your defined launch settings to launch instances when you conduct non-disruptive tests or perform a cutover.
Testing and Cutover  When you launch Test or Cutover instances, AWS  Application Migration Service automatically converts your source servers to boot and run natively on AWS. After confirming that your launched instances are operating properly on AWS, you can decommission your source servers. You can then choose to modernize your applications by leveraging additional AWS services and capabilities.
