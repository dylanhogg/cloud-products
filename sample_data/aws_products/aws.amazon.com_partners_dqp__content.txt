AWS Device Qualification Program
AWS Partners delivering validated hardware for IoT Solutions
The AWS Device Qualification Program (DQP) is a hardware validation program available to all AWS Partners, at no cost. The AWS DQP enables you to submit hardware you qualified for AWS IoT Greengrass, AWS IoT Core, AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN(R), FreeRTOS, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for listing in the AWS Partner Device Catalog. The catalog is a directory that enables AWS customers to easily discover devices qualified by participating AWS Partners and build on their solution expertise.

FreeRTOS: Qualify and list
FreeRTOS hardware qualification allows AWS Partners, such as silicon vendors, to validate the FreeRTOS port on their microcontroller (MCU) development boards to give OEM/ODM developers confidence that the development platform of their choice behaves correctly and consistently.
Developers will get a reliable and consistent experience across a wide range of qualified MCU-based development boards, which will allow them to focus on designing the application code for their product. Qualification simplifies the development experience by allowing developers to search for, verify, and select their hardware in the AWS Partner Device Catalog. It enables them to rapidly evaluate, prototype, and productize IoT solutions by abstracting the complexity of embedded development. This approach helps bridge the gap between cloud developers and embedded engineers.
Follow the three steps below to get started and qualify your hardware for listing in the catalog:
Validation
Qualification for the AWS Device Qualification Program is based on technical validation of your hardware using the AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS. AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS is a test automation tool for microcontrollers running FreeRTOS. With AWS IoT Device Tester, you can easily validate your FreeRTOS port and interoperability with AWS IoT services. AWS IoT Device Tester helps ensure cloud connectivity, over-the-air updates (OTA), and security libraries function correctly on the target devices.
Learn more about FreeRTOS qualification in the FreeRTOS Documentation.

Submission
After successful completion of the technical validation using AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS, partners submit their hardware for review through the self-service Device Listing Portal in APN Partner Central by providing the AWS IoT Device Tester test results file as qualification evidence.
The Device Listing Portal allows you to draft, submit, manage, and check the status of your listings in the AWS Partner Device Catalog. Each device submission includes relevant device specific details such as technical information, documentation, marketing content, and optional APN enablement links such as AWS Quick Starts or Solution Space.
Listing
Submissions of devices qualified by Partners go through a technical validation and content review. After successful completion, approved devices are published in the AWS Partner Device Catalog.
AWS IoT Greengrass: Qualify and list
AWS IoT Greengrass qualification allows partners to validate that their devices run AWS IoT Greengrass and interoperate with AWS IoT services, helping give OEMs and their customers the confidence that IoT Greengrass works correctly and consistently in their local edge intelligence applications.
The AWS IoT Greengrass Core software runs on a hub, gateway, or other device to automatically sync and interact with the cloud. It provides local services (compute, messaging, state, security), and communicates locally with devices that run the AWS IoT Device SDK. The IoT Greengrass Core runs on MPU-based devices (x86 or ARM) that run a general-purpose OS such as Linux, and typically requires at least 1GHz of compute (either ARM or X86), 128MB of RAM, plus additional resources to accommodate the desired OS, message throughput, and AWS Lambda execution depending on the use case. IoT Greengrass Core can run on devices that range from an ARM-based application processor platform to a highly capable server-level appliance.
Validation
Qualification for the AWS Device Qualification Program is based on technical validation of your device using the AWS IoT Device Tester for AWS IoT Greengrass. AWS IoT Device Tester for AWS IoT Greengrass is a test automation tool for your Linux-based IoT devices. With AWS IoT Device Tester, you can easily validate if your devices run AWS IoT Greengrass and interoperate with AWS IoT services. AWS IoT Device Tester tests if the CPU architecture, Linux kernel configuration, and drivers for your device work with AWS IoT Greengrass.

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN: Qualify and list
AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN® enables customers to connect wireless devices that use low-power, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) technology. Using AWS IoT Core, customers can now set-up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting their own LoRaWAN devices and gateways to the AWS Cloud without developing or operating a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). This eliminates the undifferentiated development work and operational burden of managing an LNS and associated infrastructure, accelerating the network set-up time.
Validation
Qualification is based on the technical validation that devices working with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN are connecting to AWS IoT correctly. This includes the review of connectivity, interoperability, authentication, and best practices.
More information about AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN and related developer resources are available here.
