What is AWS IoT Core?
AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT Core can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT Core, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they aren’t connected.
AWS IoT Core also makes it easy to use AWS and Amazon services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon QuickSight, and Alexa Voice Service to build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze and act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage any infrastructure.
How does AWS IoT Core work?
Connect and manage your devices
Secure device connections and data
Process and act upon device data
Read and set device state at any time
Cost-effectively scale to hundreds of millions of Alexa Built-in devices
Connect and manage your devices
AWS IoT Core allows you to easily connect any number of devices to the cloud and to other devices. AWS IoT Core supports HTTP, WebSockets, and MQTT, a lightweight communication protocol specifically designed to tolerate intermittent connections, minimize the code footprint on devices, and reduce network bandwidth requirements. AWS IoT Core also supports other industry-standard and custom protocols, and devices can communicate with each other even if they are using different protocols.
Secure device connections and data
AWS IoT Core provides automated configuration and authentication upon a device’s first connection to AWS IoT Core, as well as end-to-end encryption throughout all points of connection, so that data is never exchanged between devices and AWS IoT Core without proven identity. In addition, you can secure access to your devices and applications by applying policies with granular permissions.
Process and act upon device data
With AWS IoT Core, you can filter, transform, and act upon device data on the fly, based on business rules you define. You can update your rules to implement new device and application features at any time. AWS IoT Core makes it easy to use AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3,Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service for even more powerful IoT applications.
Read and set device state at any time
AWS IoT Core stores the latest state of a connected device so that it can be read or set at anytime, making the device appear to your applications as if it were online all the time. This means that your application can read a device’s state even when it is disconnected, and also allows you to set a device state and have it implemented when the device reconnects.
Cost-effectively scale to hundreds of millions of Alexa Built-in devices
The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT Core introduces a new virtual Alexa Built-in device in the cloud. To use the AVS Integration, customers use a new set of AWS IoT-reserved MQTT topics to transfer MQTT-based audio messages between devices connected to AWS IoT Core and the new virtual Alexa Built-in device. This allows customers to send and receive audio messages over the reserved MQTT topics, interface with the device microphone and speaker, and manage the device-side state all while using the same secure IoT Core connection.
