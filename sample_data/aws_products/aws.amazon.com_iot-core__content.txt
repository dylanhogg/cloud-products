Secure device connections and data with mutual authentication and end-to-end encryption.
Filter, transform, and act upon device data on the fly, based on your defined business rules.
How it works
AWS IoT Core lets you connect billions of IoT devices and route trillions of messages to AWS services without managing infrastructure.
Message Broker
Mirror Device State
Built-in Alexa
LoRaWAN Devices
Securely transmit messages to and from all of your IoT devices and applications with low latency and high throughput.
With Device Shadow, store the latest state of a connected device so it can be read or set at any time, making the device appear to your applications as if it were online all the time.
The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT Core introduces a new virtual Alexa device in the cloud. Use a new set of AWS IoT-reserved MQTT topics to transfer audio messages between devices.
Set up and manage a private LoRaWAN network by connecting LoRaWAN devices and gateways to the AWS cloud—all without developing or operating a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).
