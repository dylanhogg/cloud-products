AWS Cost & Usage Report
Dive deeper into your AWS costs and usage
Enable the AWS Cost & Usage Report
The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, and reservations (e.g., Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs)).
The AWS Cost & Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation purposes. You can also customize the AWS Cost & Usage Report to aggregate your usage data to the hourly, daily or monthly level.

AWS Cost & Usage Report Features
Access comprehensive AWS cost and usage information
The AWS Cost & Usage Report gives you the ability to delve deeply into your AWS cost and usage data, understand how you are using your AWS implementation, and identify opportunities for optimization. View the full data dictionary here.
Track your Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) usage
Each line item of usage that receives an RI discount contains information about where the discount was allocated. This makes it easier to trace which instances are benefitting from specific reservations.
Leverage strategic data integrations with AWS services
Using the Amazon Athena data integration feature, you can quickly query your cost and usage information using standard SQL queries. You can also upload your data directly into Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight.
Getting Started
How does the AWS Cost & Usage Report work?
AWS delivers the AWS Cost & Usage Report (in CSV format) to whichever Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket you specify, and updates the reports at least once per day. You can download any of the reports using the Amazon S3 console, or you can retrieve the reports programmatically using the Amazon S3 APIs.
You can configure your Cost & Usage Reports to integrate with Amazon Athena. Once Amazon Athena integration has been enabled for your Cost & Usage Report, your data will be delivered in compressed Apache Parquet files to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Your AWS Cost & Usage Report can also be ingested directly into Amazon Redshift or uploaded to Amazon QuickSight.
