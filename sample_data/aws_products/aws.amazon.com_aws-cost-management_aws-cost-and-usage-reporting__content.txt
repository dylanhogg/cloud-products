The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans.
The AWS Cost & Usage Report itemizes usage at the account or Organization level by product code, usage type and operation. These costs can be further organized by enabling Cost Allocation tags and Cost Categories. The AWS Cost & Usage Report is available at an hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity.

Track your Reserved Instances (RI) and Savings Plans usage
The AWS Cost & Usage Report can track down to the instance-level where purchase options such as RIs and Savings Plans are being applied. It further amortizes associated fees and provides calculations to enable internal cost allocation and showbacks based on your organization’s internal reporting needs.

How does the AWS Cost & Usage Report work?
AWS delivers the AWS Cost & Usage Report to whichever Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket you specify during setup, and updates the reports at least once per day. You can download the reports using the Amazon S3 console.
You can also configure your Cost & Usage Reports to integrate with Amazon Athena. Once Amazon Athena integration has been enabled for your Cost & Usage Report, your data will be delivered in compressed Apache Parquet files to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Your AWS Cost & Usage Report can also be integrated directly with Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight.
