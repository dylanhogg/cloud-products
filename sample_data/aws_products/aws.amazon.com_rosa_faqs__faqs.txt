What is Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS?
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) is a service operated by Red Hat and jointly supported with AWS to provide fully managed Red Hat OpenShift. ROSA provides pay-as-you-go (hourly and annual) billing on a single invoice through AWS, and the option to contact Red Hat or AWS for support. Enterprise developers familiar with deploying their applications with OpenShift on-premises will be able to more quickly build and deploy applications in the AWS public cloud, and take advantage of AWS Service Broker support for a more integrated experience when deploying applications with dependencies on AWS cloud-native services.

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS makes it simple to create and operate Red Hat OpenShift clusters on AWS. You can leverage an integrated experience for cluster creation, scalability, and unified billing model with support for hourly or annual, on-demand pricing. ROSA provides an integration with AWS APIs to support cluster creation and a fully integrated offering. For applications already containerized on-premises on OpenShift Container Platform, ROSA provides a familiar API surface and keeps the deployment toolchain the same so you can focus on refactoring the data model, not the entire application stack. As a result, you can accelerate your datacenter exit, and reduce the time gain the agility from cloud-based operational model and the financial benefits of scaling to capacity, not future needs.

You want a service that provides a managed experience for undifferentiated tasks, and flexible, self-service functionality to support deployment and management operations.
