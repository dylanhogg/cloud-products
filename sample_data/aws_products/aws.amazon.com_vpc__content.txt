Secure and monitor network connections, screen traffic, and restrict access to instances inside your virtual network.
Spend less time setting up, managing, and validating your virtual network, and concentrate on building the applications that run within it.
Customize your virtual networking environment by choosing your own IP Address range, creating subnets, and configuring route tables.
How it works
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment including resource placement, connectivity, and security. The first step is to create your VPC. Then you can add resources to it, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. Finally, you can define how your VPCs communicate with each other, across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions. In this case network traffic is being shared between two VPCs within each region.
