AWS Outposts Family
Run AWS infrastructure and services on premises for a truly consistent hybrid experience
Get started with AWS Outposts
AWS Outposts Family overview
AWS Outposts is a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience. Outposts solutions allow customers to extend and run native AWS services on premises, and is available in a variety of form factors, from 1U and 2U Outposts servers to 42U Outposts racks, and multiple rack deployments.
With AWS Outposts, you can run some AWS services locally and connect to a broad range of services available in the local AWS Region. Run applications and workloads on premises using familiar AWS services, tools, and APIs. Outposts support workloads and devices requiring low latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency, and application migration with local system interdependencies.
Benefits
Run AWS Services on premises
Extend AWS compute, networking, security, and other services on premises for low latency, local data processing, and data residency needs.
Fully managed infrastructure
Reduce the time, resources, operational risk, and maintenance downtime required to manage IT infrastructure with a fully managed experience.
Truly consistent hybrid experience
Use the same hardware infrastructure, APIs, tools, and management controls available in the cloud to provide a truly consistent developer and IT operations experience.
AWS Outposts Family members
AWS Outposts rack
The AWS Outposts rack is an industry standard 42U form factor. It provides the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter or co-location space. Outposts rack provides AWS compute, storage, database, and other services locally, while still allowing you to access the full range of AWS services available in the Region for a truly consistent hybrid experience. Scale from a single 42U rack to multiple rack deployments of up to 96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity.
AWS Outposts servers
The AWS Outposts servers come in a 1U or 2U form factor. They provide the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to on-premises and edge locations that have limited space or smaller capacity requirements, such as retail stores, branch offices, healthcare provider locations, or factory floors. Outposts servers provide local compute and networking services.
Feature comparison
Form factors
The Outposts racks is 80 inches tall, 24 inches wide, and 48 inches deep. Inside are hosts, switches, a network patch panel, a power shelf, and blank panels.
The Outposts rack-mountable servers fit inside a 19" width, EIA-310 cabinets. The 1U high server is 24” deep, and uses AWS Graviton2 processors. The 2U high server is 30” deep and uses 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
Installation
AWS delivers Outposts racks fully assembled and ready to be rolled into final position. Racks are installed by AWS and simply need to be plugged into power and network.
AWS delivers Outposts servers directly to you, installed by either onsite personnel install or a 3rd-party vendor. Once connected to your network, AWS will remotely provision compute and storage resources.
Locally supported services
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon EBS Snapshots, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon Elasticache, Amazon EMR, Application Load Balancer (ALB), CloudEndure, and VMware Cloud. Seamlessly extend Amazon Virtual Private Cloud on premises and run select AWS services locally on Outposts rack, and connect to a broad range of services available in the AWS Region.
Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, AWS IoT Greengrass, or Amazon Sagemaker Edge Manager. Seamlessly extend Amazon Virtual Private Cloud on premises and run select AWS services locally on Outposts servers, and connect to a broad range of services available in the AWS Region.
Networking
• 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, and 100 Gbps uplink speeds. • Includes integrated networking gear. • Supports Local Gateway which requires Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a routed network.
• 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps uplink speeds. • Does not include integrated networking gear. • Supports a simplified network integration experience providing a local Layer 2 presence.
Power
• Supports three power configurations: 5 kVA, 10 kVA, or 15 kVA. The configuration of the power shelf depends on the total power draw of the Outpost capacity. • Centralized redundant power conversion unit and a direct current (DC) distribution system in the backplane handled by line mate connectors.
• Requires 1-2 kVA of power. • Supports standard alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power options.
Use cases
Low latency compute
Deliver high-quality gaming experiences for interactive applications, like real-time multiplayer games, to players all over the world. When the nearest public cloud servers are not close enough to meet single-digit millisecond latency requirements, AWS Outposts can help run business applications where you need them for manufacturing execution systems (MES), high-frequency trading, or medical diagnostics.
Data residency
Data sometimes needs to remain in a particular country, state, or municipality for regulatory, contractual, or information security reasons. This is often the case with financial services, healthcare, oil and gas, and other highly regulated industries. With AWS Outposts, you can control where your workloads run and where your data resides, with low-friction movement between cloud and edge locations to easily adapt to regulatory changes.
Migration and modernization
Legacy on-premises applications often have latency-sensitive system dependencies, making them difficult to migrate. AWS Outposts allows you to segment migrations into smaller pieces on premises, maintaining latency sensitive connectivity between application components until you are ready to migrate.
Local data processing
Process data locally for use cases such as data lakes and machine learning (ML) model training, or set up a consistent hybrid architecture to process local, difficult-to-migrate data sets with cost, size, or bandwidth constraints and move data to the cloud for long-term archival.
