Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
Fast, scalable, highly available MongoDB-compatible database service
Get started with Amazon DocumentDB
Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. As a document database, Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to store, query, and index JSON data.
Amazon DocumentDB is a non-relational database service designed from the ground-up to give you the performance, scalability, and availability you need when operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads at scale. In Amazon DocumentDB, the storage and compute are decoupled, allowing each to scale independently, and you can increase the read capacity to millions of requests per second by adding up to 15 low latency read replicas in minutes, regardless of the size of your data.
Amazon DocumentDB is designed for 99.99% availability and replicates six copies of your data across three AWS Availability Zones (AZs). You can use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for free (for six months) to easily migrate your on-premises or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) MongoDB databases to Amazon DocumentDB with virtually no downtime.
Introduction to Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
Benefits
MongoDB-compatible
Amazon DocumentDB implements the Apache 2.0 open source MongoDB 3.6 and 4.0 APIs by emulating the responses that a MongoDB client expects from a MongoDB server, allowing you to use your existing MongoDB drivers and tools with Amazon DocumentDB. Updating the application is as easy as changing the database endpoint to the new Amazon DocumentDB cluster. Learn more about supported MongoDB APIs.

Fully managed
With Amazon DocumentDB, you don’t need to worry about database management tasks, such as hardware provisioning, patching, setup, configuration, backups, or scaling. Amazon DocumentDB automatically and continuously monitors and backs up your cloud database to Amazon S3, enabling point-in-time recovery (up to the second for the last 35 days).
Performance at scale
Amazon DocumentDB achieves twice the throughput of currently available MongoDB managed services. Amazon DocumentDB’s architecture separates storage and compute, allowing each to scale independently, so that you can easily scale read capacity to millions of requests per second by adding up to 15 low latency read replicas across three Availability Zones in minutes, regardless of data size. Amazon DocumentDB uses a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 64 TB per database cluster.
Use cases
Content and catalog management
Shopping sites, online publications, digital archives, point-of-sale terminals, and self-service kiosks rely on content and catalog management systems to serve their customers. These systems need fast and reliable access to user reviews, images, ratings, product information, comments, etc. With Amazon DocumentDB’s flexible document model, data types, and indexing, you can store and query content (e.g., user reviews and demo videos for shopping sites) and catalogs (e.g., inventory lists for point-of-sale terminals and financial trades for trading platforms) quickly and intuitively using a simple database service.
Profile management
User profile management enables online transactions, user preferences, and user authentication. With the growth in users, increasingly complex user profile data, and growing user experience expectations, the demand for scalability, data flexibility, and performance too has grown. With Amazon DocumentDB’s document data model, you can manage profiles & preferences of millions of users & scale to process millions of user requests per second with millisecond latency with a fully-managed non-relational database service.
Mobile and web applications
Build high-performance mobile and web applications that scale to process millions of user requests per second with millisecond latency. As a website database or database for mobile applications, Amazon DocumentDB lowers your operational burden, allowing you to focus on building unique experiences for your customers. Amazon DocumentDB’s flexible document model, data types, and indexing allow you to adapt and iterate on your applications quickly, cutting down development time.
How it works
Migrate your self-managed MongoDB workloads to Amazon DocumentDB
Self-managing MongoDB databases is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. With Amazon DocumentDB, you can set up, secure, and scale MongoDB-compatible databases in the cloud without worrying about manually setting up and securing database clusters, running cluster management software, configuring backups, and monitoring production workloads.

Store, query, and index JSON data
As a document database, a type of NoSQL database, Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to insert, query, index, and perform aggregations over JSON data. JSON is a de facto format for data exchange, a common output of modern APIs, and modeling application data as JSON is intuitive for developers. Being able to store and query JSON data in its natural format, and without translation, enables developers to iterate faster and be more productive.

“Prior to DocumentDB, we used MongoDB. While MongoDB gave us scale and a rich query language, managing the databases directly meant that we had less time to innovate for our customers. DocumentDB gave us an opportunity to benefit from the features we were already familiar with while reducing the amount of time we spent on database administration. We can ship features faster and spend more time focusing on the customer needs.”
Sergey Podlazov, Director of Engineering, Shopping Experience - Zulily
“In order to solve problems aggreggating data with no clear relational model, we migrated to Amazon DocumentDB to get the benefits of a fully managed service where we can store and query our data in a simple and reliable way. Further, because high availability, durability, and backup are enabled by default, those are tasks that we no longer need to worry about, and that frees up developers to work on new capabilities.”
Alfonso Afonso, Software Engineering Team Lead - BBC
“Dow Jones uses a number of specialized databases including MongoDB to provide a variety of services for our customers. We are excited about collaborating with AWS around Amazon DocumentDB, which meets key needs we expressed to AWS in order to simplify our operations and free up our developers to invest in innovative experiences for our customers rather than undifferentiated operations."

“We have 2,000 different databases in production, with DocumentDB being the second most prominent. We had to make small adjustments to transition from MongoDB to Amazon DocumentDB, but after we did, we found that with a lot less code, we could accomplish the same tasks with a lot more stability. Now, engineers have maybe 5 percent of the problems they had before, and if they have problems, it’s a problem with the logic or on the application side, not because Amazon DocumentDB is doing something wrong.”
Marcelo Soto, Head of Data Platform - Rappi
