You can get started with a free trial of Amazon WorkDocs and sign up 50 users at no charge for the first 30 days.
You will be charged for the following types of Amazon WorkDocs usage:
Number of user accounts per month: the number of users billed in a month is based on the average numbers of active user accounts throughout the month. For every active user your business will be charged a monthly subscription fee. If a user account is deactivated or activated during the month, the monthly subscription fee for that account will be prorated based on the number of active days.
Additional storage: your business receives 1 TB of storage capacity for each active user account. Administrators can allocate this storage across users by setting individual storage limits in the WorkDocs administrator dashboard. Your business will be charged once a user’s amount of storage utilized exceeds 1 TB for that user’s account. Additional storage is charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Q: How does the billing work for auto-activation?
With WorkDocs, there are no upfront fees and commitments. You pay only for active users and the storage you use.

In most regions, WorkDocs costs $5 per user per month and includes 1TB of storage for each user. WorkDocs provides a 30-day free trial with 1TB of storage per user for up to 50 users.

Each user you invite to your Amazon WorkDocs site will automatically be added to the directory. Second, you can use your existing Microsoft Active Directory with Amazon WorkDocs by using the AWS Active Directory Connector, or by integrating with AWS Microsoft AD using Active Directory trust relationships. To learn more about using your existing Active Directory with WorkDocs, please see Connecting to an On-Premise Directory.
Q: Can I use my existing Active Directory to manage Amazon WorkDocs users?
Yes. You can connect your existing Active Directory to Amazon WorkDocs using the AD Connector, or the AWS Microsoft AD service. To learn more about using your existing Active Directory with WorkDocs, please see Connecting to an On-Premise Directory.

Q: What is auto-activation?
Auto-activation assists admins in deploying WorkDocs for their organization. Upon provisioning a WorkDocs site with a directory, auto-activation enables all directory users with a valid WorkDocs account which allows them to sign in and begin using WorkDocs without requiring the site admin to manually invite the user.
Q: How do I access auto-activation feature?
The auto-activation of active directory users is available by default to all active directory sites. Simply attach your directory when provisioning your WorkDocs site and upon deployment the auto-activation of all directory users will occur. That is, all directory users will have a valid WorkDocs account and as a result will be able to sign in and begin using WorkDocs without the admin having to manually invite each user.
Q: How does auto-activation feature benefit me and my organization?
Automatically activating active directory users for large organizations removes the manual workload from the admin, thus allowing for seamless single sign-on (SSO). Historically, the admin was required to add every individual active directory user to their WorkDocs site by manually entering their email address and then activating the user, thus preventing bulk deployment across an organization. Now, with auto-activation, the provisioning and deployment of your WorkDocs site is made easy and your users can begin using WorkDocs without any manual dependencies.
Q: Is a user notified when the auto-activation occurs?
The site administrators own how they want to communicate to directory users that they have a valid WorkDocs account and can thus login to get started with WorkDocs.
