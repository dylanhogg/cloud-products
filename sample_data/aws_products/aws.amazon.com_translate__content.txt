Easy to Integrate into Your Applications
Amazon Translate removes the complexity of building real-time and batch translation capabilities into your applications with a simple API call. This makes it easy to localize an application or web site, or process multilingual data within your existing workflows.
Customizable
With Custom Terminology and Active Custom Translation, Amazon Translate lets you customize your machine translated output. Use Custom Terminology to define how your brand names, model names, and other unique terms get translated. Use Active Custom Translation to generate a custom machine translated output that is tailored for your domain specific needs. You don’t need to build a custom translation model, you can update your model as often as you need, and you only pay for the number of characters you translate.
Cost effective
With the power of machine translation, Amazon Translate is about a 1000x cheaper than having your content manually translated by a professional translator.
Scalable
Whether it’s just a few words or large volumes of text, Amazon Translate easily scales to meet your translation needs with fast and reliable translations.
Versatile
Amazon Translate can translate various content formats including Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, and Excel spreadsheets.
Use cases
Language Localization
It’s very difficult for human translation teams to keep up with dynamic or real-time content. With Amazon Translate, you can easily translate massive volumes of user-generated content in real-time. Websites and applications can automatically make content such as feed stories, profile descriptions, and comments, available in the user's preferred language with a click of a “translate” button.
Text Analytics
With Amazon Translate, you are not restricted by language barriers. Understand the social sentiment of your brand, product, or service while monitoring online conversations in different languages. Simply translate the text to English before using a natural language processing (NLP) application like Amazon Comprehend to analyze textual content in a multitude of languages.
Communication
Amazon Translate can provide automatic translation to enable cross-lingual communications between users for your applications. By adding real-time translation to chat, email, helpdesk, and ticketing applications, an English-speaking agent or employee can communicate with customers across multiple languages.
