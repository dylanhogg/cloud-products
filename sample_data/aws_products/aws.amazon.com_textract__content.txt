Amazon Textract
Easily extract printed text, handwriting, and data from virtually any document
Get started with Amazon Textract
Amazon Textract is a fully managed machine learning service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and other data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables.
Many companies today extract data from scanned documents, such as PDF's, tables and forms, through manual data entry (that is slow, expensive and prone to errors), or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration which needs to be updated each time the form changes to be usable.
To overcome these manual processes, Textract uses machine learning to instantly read and process any type of document, accurately extracting printed text, handwriting, forms, tables and, other data without the need for any manual effort or custom code.
With Textract you can quickly automate manual document activities, enabling you to process millions of document pages in hours. Once the information is captured, you can take action on it within your business applications to initiate next steps for a loan application, tax document, enrollment form or medical claims processing. Additionally, you can create smart search indexes, or add in human reviews with
Amazon Augmented AI to review nuanced or sensitive data.
Benefits
Extract structured & unstructured data quickly and accurately
Amazon Textract uses artificial intelligence to “read” documents as a person would, to extract not only printed text, and handwriting but also tables, forms, and other structured data without configuration, training, or custom code. Amazon Textract automatically detects a document’s layout and the key elements on the page, understands the data relationships in any embedded forms or tables, and extracts everything with its context intact.
Go beyond simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Amazon Textract uses OCR technology to identify form labels and values and extracts information from tables without compromising the structure at a low cost. You only pay for what you use and there are no upfront commitments or long-term contracts.
Security & Compliance
Textract is compliant in Service Organization Control (SOC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as well as PCI, HIPAA and GDPR which means customers can get deep insights into the security processes and controls that protect customer data. In addition, Textract supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints via AWS Privatelink and KMS, enabling customers to avoid using the public internet and encrypt their data.
Easily implement human reviews
Amazon Textract is directly integrated with Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) so you can easily implement human review of printed text and handwriting extracted from documents. You can build-in human reviews to manage nuanced or sensitive workflows that require human judgement to get high confidence predictions or to audit predictions on an on-going basis.
What is Amazon Textract (1:49)
Use cases
Create smart search indexes
Extract structured data from documents and create a smart index to allow you to search through millions of financial statements quickly. For example, a mortgage company could use Amazon Textract to process millions of scanned loan applications in a matter of hours and have the extracted data indexed in Amazon Elasticsearch. This would allow them to create search experiences like “search for loan applications where applicant name is John Doe,” or “search contracts where the interest rate is 2 percent.”
Build automated document processing workflows
Amazon Textract can provide the inputs required to automatically process forms without human intervention. For example, banks can automate loan applications using Amazon Textract. The information contained in the document could be used to initiate all of the necessary background and credit checks to approve the loan so that customers can get instant results of their application rather than having to wait several days for manual review and validation.
Maintain compliance in document archives
Because Amazon Textract identifies data types and form labels automatically, it’s easy to maintain compliance with information controls. For example, an insurer could use Amazon Textract to feed a workflow that automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) for their review before archiving claim forms by automatically recognizing the important key-value pairs that require protection.

Change Healthcare is a leading independent healthcare technology company that provides data and analytics-driven solutions to improve clinical, financial and patient engagement outcomes in the U.S. healthcare system.
"At Change Healthcare, we believe that we can make healthcare affordable and accessible to all by improving the timeliness and quality of financial and administrative decisions. This can be achieved by the power of machine learning technology to understand more from our data. But unlocking the potential of this information can often be difficult as it's siloed in tables and forms that traditional optical character recognition hasn't been able to analyze. Amazon Textract further advances document understanding with the ability to retrieve structured data in addition to text, and now with the service becoming HIPAA compliant, we'll be able to liberate the information from millions of documents and create even more value for patients, payers, and providers.”
