Q: Why should I use AWS Migration Hub?
AWS Migration Hub provides a single place to discover your existing servers and track the status of each application migration. It gives you better visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines migration tracking. If you plan to migrate some or all of your portfolio to AWS using tools like AWS Server Migration Service, AWS Database Migration Service, CloudEndure Migration, or partner tools, then you should consider using Migration Hub. Migration Hub is optimized for tracking application migration status when moving your portfolio to AWS. If you are rehosting servers and/or replatforming databases in AWS, then Migration Hub can reduce time spent determining current status and next steps.
Q: What migration tools integrate with AWS Migration Hub?
AWS Server Migration Service, AWS Database Migration Service, CloudEndure Migration, and ATADATA ATAmotion are integrated with AWS Migration Hub and automatically report migration status to Migration Hub. See the Migration Hub Documentation for more details about authorizing tools to send status to Migration Hub.
Q: How does AWS Migration Hub help me track the progress of my application migrations?
AWS Migration Hub helps you by providing visibility into your migration progress. You use one of the integrated migration tools and then return to the hub to see the status of your migration. You can group servers into applications once the migration has started or, optionally, you can discover and group your servers before you start.
Q: How does AWS Migration Hub help me understand my IT environment?
AWS Migration Hub helps you understand your IT environment by letting you explore information collected by AWS discovery tools and stored in the AWS Application Discovery Service’s repository. With the repository populated, you can view technical specifications and performance information about the discovered resources in Migration Hub. You can export data from the Application Discovery Service repository, analyze it, and import server groupings as an “application”. Once grouped, the application grouping is used to aggregate the migration status from each migration tool used to migrate the servers and databases in the application.
Q: How much does it cost to use AWS Migration Hub?
Migration Hub is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge. You only pay for the cost of the migration tools you use, and any resources being consumed on AWS.
Getting started
Q: How do I get started with AWS Migration Hub?
Follow the Getting Started Guide in our documentation to get started.
Q: What is the Migration Hub home region?
Before using the Migration Hub, you need to select a Migration Hub home region from the Migration Hub Settings page or using the Migration Hub Config API. The Migration Hub home region is the only AWS region used to store your discovery, planning, and migration tracking data. The data stored in the Migration Hub home region provides a single repository of discovery and migration planning information for your entire portfolio and a single view of migrations into multiple AWS regions. You can migrate into any AWS region supported by your migration tools and the migration status will appear in your selected Migration Hub home region. See the docs to learn more about the Migration Hub home region.
Note: Once set, the Migration Hub home region cannot be changed.
Q: What regions can I migrate to using AWS Migration Hub?
AWS Migration Hub helps you track the status of your migrations in all AWS commercial regions, provided your migration tools are available in that region. The migration tools that integrate with Migration Hub (e.g., CloudEndure, AWS Database Migration Service) send migration status to your selected Migration Hub home region. The Migration Hub home region is used to store your discovery and migration tracking data and is set prior to first use of the service. Migration status is aggregated from all destination regions and visible in the home region. Note that integrated tools will not send status unless you have authorized (i.e., connected) them on the Tools page of the Migration Hub console.
Q: Where is AWS Migration Hub available?
AWS Migration Hub is available worldwide. This means you can view and track progress of application migrations regardless of their location. To see which regions the service is hosted in, please refer to the AWS Region Table.
Q: How is access granted to AWS Migration Hub?
AWS Migration Hub requires an AWS Account role which will be automatically added the first time you access the console as an admin user. Integrated migration tools can be authorized on the Tools page of the Migration Hub console. Please see the Authentication and Access Control section of the AWS Migration Hub User Guide for more details.
Discovering servers and grouping applications
Q: How do I view my IT portfolio in AWS Migration Hub?
In order to view your IT assets in AWS Migration Hub, you perform discovery using an AWS discovery tool or by migrating with an integrated migration tool. Once you’ve performed discovery or started migrating, you can explore your environment from within Migration Hub. You can learn more about any resource found by clicking on the server ID shown on the Servers page of the Migration Hub console. You then see the server details page. If you used an AWS discovery tool to discover your servers, then you will see collected data including technical specifications and average utilization.
Q: How do I add resources into the Discovery Repository?
When you first visit AWS Migration Hub, you are prompted to perform discovery or start migrating. If you decide to start migrating without performing discovery, then your application servers and database servers will appear as resources in the Migration Hub as you migrate them with integrated migration tools that you’ve authorized in the Migration Hub Management Console.
For discovery, you have two data collection options. If you have a VMware environment and prefer not to install an agent, then you can use the AWS Application Discovery Service agentless collector. If you need more detailed information, then you can install agents on your servers that collect a wide variety of information including details about resource utilization, processes running on the server, and the server’s network dependencies. Process and network dependency information is available for export and analysis outside AWS Migration Hub. Please see the Application Discovery Service User Guide for more info on the AWS Discovery Collectors.
Q: How do I group servers into an application?
Before grouping servers into an application, you need to populate AWS Migration Hub’s Servers list. Servers are added to the Servers list whenever you run AWS discovery tools or by using an integrated migration tool. Once your Servers list is populated, select one or more resources on the Servers page in the Migration Hub console and then choose the “Group as Application” button. If you’re discovering servers using the AWS Discovery agent, you can also group servers into applications from the network visualization tool. Select one or more servers from the network graph and choose the “Group as application” button.
Q: How do I view applications?
You can visit the Applications page in the Migrate section of the AWS Migration Hub console to see the list of applications and their current migration status. Only resources that are grouped to applications using the Discover section’s Servers page or AWS SDK/CLI will appear on the Applications page. Applications can have one of three migration statuses: “not started”, “in-progress”, and “completed”.
Q: Can I see applications created by other users within the same account?
Yes, applications created by any IAM User within an account will be visible to any other IAM Users within the same account that is granted access to AWS Migration Hub. Any changes made will be visible to all users with permission.
Q: Can I see applications that exist in other AWS accounts?
You access AWS Migration Hub using an IAM User associated with an AWS account. This only allows you to see details from your AWS account; you do not have visibility into other accounts.
Importing servers and applications
Q: How does the AWS Migration Hub import feature work?
Q: How does the Migration Hub import feature work?
You can access the AWS Migration Hub import feature either from the Migration Hub console or by invoking the Application Discovery Service APIs. The imported data is stored in the Application Discovery Service data repository in encrypted format.
Q: What kind of data can I import using the import template?
Migration Hub import allows you to import server details, including server specifications, utilization, tags and applications that are associated with your servers. You can import data from any source as long as the data is populated using the Migration Hub CSV import template.
Q: I imported an incorrect file. Can I overwrite or delete it?
Yes, you can delete an incorrect file by visiting the Discover→Tools→Imports section and then selecting the “Delete imported data” option. To overwrite an existing imported file, you can delete the existing file and upload a new file with the corrected records.
Q: Is there a limit on the number of import files that I can upload?
No, there is no limit on the number of import files that you can upload. However, we do restrict the number of records and servers that you can import. For details, please refer to Migration Hub import limits section in the documentation.
Q: Do I need to pay for importing data?
No, there is no charge for importing your data.
Q: I do not have data for all the fields in the import template. Can I still import my data?
Yes, you can import data even if you do not have data populated for all the fields in the import template. For each row, if you populate your own matching key (“ExternalId”), import will use it to uniquely identify and import the records. If you do not specify the matching key, for each row, import will use the values specified for “IPAddress”, “HostName”, “MACAddress” or combination of “VMware.MoRefId” and “VMware.vCenterId” to determine the uniqueness of a given server. Rows that do not contain value for the matching key (“ExternalId”) or for any of the above fields will not get imported.
Q: What are the criteria for identifying an incorrect record?
Import does a data validation check for all the imported fields that are part of the CSV import template. For example, if the value of the “IPAddress” is invalid, then the Import feature will flag that record as incorrect. In addition, any import record that does not have at least one or more of these fields populated: “ExternalId”, “MACAddress”, “HostName”, “IPAddress” or combination of “VMware.VCenterId” and “VMware.MoRefId” will be considered invalid and won’t be imported.
Generating EC2 instance recommendations
Q: What is the EC2 instance recommendations feature?
EC2 instance recommendations is a feature of AWS Migration Hub that analyzes the data collected from each on-premises server, including server specification, CPU, and memory utilization, to recommend the least expensive EC2 instance required to run the on-premises workload. You can also fine-tune recommendations by specifying preferences for AWS purchasing option, AWS Region, EC2 instance type exclusions, and CPU/RAM utilization metric (average, peak, or percentile).
Q: Do I need to install AWS Application Discovery Service's Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent to use the EC2 instance recommendations feature?
No. To use the EC2 instance recommendations feature, you need to ensure that on-premises server details are available in the AWS Migration Hub. You can either import existing server inventory information from a source such as a Content Management Database (CMDB), or use the AWS Application Discovery Service to collect data directly from your environment.
Q: How does the EC2 instance recommendations feature provide a match for a given server?
The EC2 instance recommendations feature recommends the most cost-effective EC2 instance type that can satisfy the given CPU and RAM requirements while taking into account your selected instance type preferences such as AWS purchasing option, AWS Region, EC2 instance type exclusions, and CPU/RAM utilization metric (average, peak, or percentile).
Q: Does the EC2 instance recommendations feature provide recommendations for Burstable Performance Instances?
Yes, the EC2 instance recommendations feature provides recommendations for Burstable Performance Instances. For Burstable Performance Instances, the feature uses “average” and “peak” CPU data points to compute an estimated number of consumed CPU credits and associated cost to more accurately compare the projected price with other instance families.
Q: What happens if I have discovery data from multiple sources for the same server in AWS Migration Hub? Which data source is used to calculate the EC2 instance recommendation for that server?
If discovery data is available from multiple sources for the same server, the EC2 instance recommendations feature will use the most recent and complete data to provide an instance recommendation. For example, if you upload the CPU/RAM specification for a given server using Migration Hub import, a recommendation will be generated based on the imported data. If you then install the AWS Application Discovery Service's (ADS) Discovery Agent on this server, the ADS agent will also capture the server specification details. The next time you request EC2 instance recommendations for that server, the feature will use the ADS agent-collected specifications to generate the recommendation, since the agent's data is more recent and complete.
Q: Does the EC2 instance recommendations feature recommend current generation instances?
Yes, the EC2 instance recommendations feature only recommends current generation instances. It does not provide recommendations for previous generation instances.
Q: When should I use the EC2 instance recommendations feature in AWS Migration Hub versus a more detailed cost assessment with TSO Logic?
Right-sizing your compute resources is one dimension of understanding your total cost of ownership (TCO). Use the EC2 instance recommendation feature of Migration Hub when you want an understanding of your projected EC2 costs. We also offer a more detailed assessment, including optimizations for Microsoft licensing and storage costs, using TSO Logic, an Amazon Web Services Company. Contact AWS Sales or an AWS Partner to learn more about this detailed assessment.
Tracking migration status
Q: How do I use AWS Migration Hub when migrating applications?
After you’ve created one or more application groupings from servers discovered using AWS discovery tools or discovered by starting to migrate using an integrated migration tool, you can start or continue to migrate the server or database outside Migration Hub. Return to Migration Hub to view the migration status of each resource in the application.
To do this, visit that application’s page in the Migration Hub console. There, you will see a diagram with all the resources that make up the application as well as a table with more migration status details. For each resource, the general and detailed status of the migration is shown as both a diagram and a table. For instance, for a server being migrated by AWS Server Migration Service, it may report its status as “In progress / replication starting”, “In progress / replication complete”, or “Competed / AMI created”.
When the migration completes, AWS Migration Hub also shows details about the resources that have been created by the migration. For servers migrated by AWS Server Migration Service, CloudEndure Migration, and ATADATA, Migration Hub provides links to the AMIs created or running Amazon EC2 instances (depending on the tool). For databases migrated by AWS Database Migration Service, Migration Hub provides the Target Endpoint ID which can be used as a search filter on the Database Migration Service Management Console.
Q: Does AWS Migration Hub automatically migrate my applications for me?
No. AWS Migration Hub does not automate the steps of the migration. Migration Hub provides a single place for you to track the progress of the applications you are migrating.
Q: What do I need to do in order for my application’s migration progress to appear in AWS Migration Hub?
In order to view migration progress in AWS Migration Hub, two things must be true. The resources that you are migrating must be in the AWS Discovery repository and you must use supported tools to perform the migration. If you start migrating without performing discovery with AWS Discovery Collectors, the servers or databases reported by supported migration tools will be automatically added to your AWS Application Discovery Service repository. Once added, you can group these servers as applications and track their status in a single grouping as the migration progresses.
If you are using a supported tool but not seeing the status in an application, first check the Updates page to verify the status is being received from the tool. If the status is not appearing on the Updates page, then check the Tools page to verify you’ve authorized the tool to send status to the Migration Hub. If it is not authorized, click “Authorize” to add the appropriate IAM permissions.
If the migration status appears on the updates page, then it could be that the resource is not grouped into an application. Visit the Servers page and group the server to an application. Once grouped, view the application from the Migrate/Applications page to see the status migration status.
Q: What is the experience if I don’t do a strict re-host migration, moving the resources exactly from on-premises to AWS?
AWS Migration Hub will show the status of the resource migrations that are done with supported tools, provided the resource is grouped in an application. It does not need to be a strict re-host migration. For instance, if you move the contents of a database using AWS Database Migration Service, you will see updates in Migration Hub if the server corresponding to the database migration is grouped in an application.
Q: What if I am using a tool that is not integrated with AWS Migration Hub?
Tools that are not integrated with AWS Migration Hub will not report status in the Migration Hub Management Console. You can still see the status of other resources in the application and the application level status or you can update the status via your own automation using the CLI or APIs.
Q: How can other tools publish status to AWS Migration Hub?
Migration tools can publish your status to AWS Migration Hub by writing to the AWS Migration Hub API. Partners interested in onboarding must have achieved the Migration Competency through the AWS Competency Program. Learn more about the Competency Program and apply for the Migration Competency here.
