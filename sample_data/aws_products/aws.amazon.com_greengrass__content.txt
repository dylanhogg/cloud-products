Build faster using pre-built or custom modular components, which you can easily add or remove from devices to control your device software footprint.
Deploy and manage device software and configuration remotely and at scale without firmware updates.
Bring cloud processing and logic locally to edge devices and operate even with intermittent connection.
Program your devices to transmit only high-value data, making it easy to deliver rich insights at a lower cost.
How it works
AWS IoT Greengrass is an open-source edge runtime and cloud service for building, deploying, and managing device software.
IoT devices can vary in size, ranging from smaller microcontroller-based devices to large appliances. AWS IoT Greengrass Core devices, AWS IoT Device SDK-enabled devices, and FreeRTOS devices can be configured to communicate with one another. If the AWS IoT Greengrass Core device loses connectivity to the cloud, connected devices can continue to communicate with each other over the local network.
AWS IoT Greengrass provides pre-built components so you can easily extend edge device functionality without writing code. AWS IoT Greengrass components enable you to add features, and quickly connect to AWS services or third-party applications at the edge.
Use cases
Run at the edge
AWS IoT Greengrass makes it easy to bring intelligence to edge devices, such as for anomaly detection in precision agriculture or powering autonomous devices.
Manage apps
Deploy new or legacy apps across fleets using any language, packaging technology, or runtime.
Control fleets
Manage and operate device fleets in the field locally or remotely using MQTT or other protocols.
Process locally
Collect, aggregate, filter, and send data locally. Manage and control what data goes to the cloud for optimized analytics and storage.
