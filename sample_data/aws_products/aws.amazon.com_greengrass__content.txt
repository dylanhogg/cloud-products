AWS IoT Greengrass
Bring local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices
Get Started with AWS IoT Greengrass
AWS IoT Greengrass is an Internet of Things (IoT) open source edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build, deploy, and manage device software. Customers use AWS IoT Greengrass for their IoT applications on millions of devices in homes, factories, vehicles, and businesses. You can program your devices to act locally on the data they generate, execute predictions based on machine learning models, filter and aggregate device data, and only transmit necessary information to the cloud.
AWS IoT Greengrass lets you quickly and easily build intelligent device software. AWS IoT Greengrass enables local processing, messaging, data management, ML inference, and offers pre-built components to accelerate application development. AWS IoT Greengrass also provides a secure way to seamlessly connect your edge devices to any AWS service as well as to third-party services.
Once software development is complete, AWS IoT Greengrass enables you to remotely manage and operate software on your devices in the field without needing a firmware update. AWS IoT Greengrass helps keep your devices up-to-date and makes them smarter over time.

Benefits
Build intelligent devices faster
With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can use a variety of programming languages, development environments, and open source software to develop, test, and launch your IoT applications on the hardware of your choice. You have the option to use execution environments such as AWS Lambda functions, Docker containers, or native OS processes for your applications. Further, AWS IoT Greengrass allows you to add or remove pre-built software components to meet the needs of your IoT use case, so you can control the footprint of your device software.
Deploy device software at scale
With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can develop code on a local device or in the cloud, and then remotely deploy and manage your software seamlessly on millions of devices without needing a firmware update. You can also organize your devices in groups and deploy and manage device software and configuration to a subset of devices or to all devices at once, simplifying the management and operations of your device fleets.
Operate offline
AWS IoT Greengrass devices are able to act locally on the data they generate, respond quickly to local events, and reduce latency. AWS IoT Greengrass also lets connected devices operate even with intermittent connectivity to the cloud. Devices can collect, process, and export data streams, even when they are offline. When the device reconnects, AWS IoT Greengrass synchronizes the data on the device with cloud services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Kinesis, AWS IoT Core, or AWS IoT Analytics.
Secure your device communications
AWS IoT Greengrass authenticates and encrypts device data for both local and cloud communications so that data is never exchanged between devices and the cloud without proven identity. You can also leverage hardware-secured end-to-end encryption for messages sent between an AWS IoT Greengrass Core and the AWS cloud, and messages between an AWS IoT Greengrass Core and other local devices using the AWS IoT Device SDK.
Reduce the cost of running IoT applications
You can get rich insights at a lower cost by programming your device to filter or aggregate data locally and only transmit the data you need for your applications to the cloud. This reduces the amount of raw data transmitted to the cloud, minimizing cost and increasing the quality of the data you send to the cloud.
Validate your AWS IoT Greengrass devices
AWS IoT Device Tester for AWS IoT Greengrass is a test automation tool that makes testing your choice of devices easy. You can use the AWS IoT Device Tester to confidently self-test if your devices will run AWS IoT Greengrass and interoperate with AWS IoT services. You can use the AWS Partner Device Catalog to browse and buy devices that have been qualified by AWS to work optimally with AWS IoT Greengrass.
How it works
AWS IoT Greengrass lets you build IoT solutions that enable devices to connect to the cloud or locally to other devices. Devices that run Linux, including distributions such as Ubuntu and Raspbian, and support Arm or x86 architectures can host the AWS IoT Greengrass Core. The AWS IoT Greengrass Core enables the local execution of AWS Lambda code, Docker containers, or native OS processes. AWS IoT Greengrass Core can run on individual IoT devices or it can act as a hub that communicates with other devices that are running FreeRTOS or using the AWS IoT Device SDK.
IoT devices can vary in size, ranging from smaller microcontroller-based devices to large appliances. AWS IoT Greengrass Core devices, AWS IoT Device SDK-enabled devices, and FreeRTOS devices can be configured to communicate with one another. If the AWS IoT Greengrass Core device loses connectivity to the cloud, connected devices can continue to communicate with each other over the local network.
AWS IoT Greengrass provides pre-built components so you can easily extend edge device functionality without writing code. AWS IoT Greengrass components enable you to add features, and quickly connect to AWS services or third-party applications at the edge.
