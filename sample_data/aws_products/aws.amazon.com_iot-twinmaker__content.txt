Use your existing IoT, video, and enterprise application data where it already lives—without needing to reingest or move the data to another location.
Save time with an automatically generated knowledge graph that binds your data sources to virtual replicas of physical systems to accurately model real-world environments.
Get an immersive 3D view of your systems and operations to optimize efficiency, increase production, and improve performance.
How it works
AWS IoT TwinMaker makes it easier for developers to create digital twins of real-world systems such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. AWS IoT TwinMaker provides the tools you need to build digital twins to help you optimize building operations, increase production output, and improve equipment performance. With the ability to use existing data from multiple sources, create virtual representations of any physical environment, and combine existing 3D models with real-world data, you can now harness digital twins to create a holistic view of your operations faster and with less effort.
