Amazon DevOps Guru
ML-powered cloud operations service to improve application availability
Get started with the preview of Amazon DevOps Guru
Amazon DevOps Guru is a Machine Learning (ML) powered service that makes it easy to improve an application’s operational performance and availability. DevOps Guru detects behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns so you can identify operational issues long before they impact your customers.
DevOps Guru uses machine learning models informed by years of Amazon.com and AWS operational excellence to identify anomalous application behavior (e.g. increased latency, error rates, resource constraints, etc.) and surface critical issues that could cause potential outages or service disruptions. When DevOps Guru identifies a critical issue, it automatically sends an alert and provides a summary of related anomalies, the likely root cause, and context about when and where the issue occurred. When possible DevOps Guru, also provides recommendations on how to remediate the issue.
DevOps Guru automatically ingests operational data from your AWS applications and provides a single dashboard to visualize issues in your operational data. You can get started with DevOps Guru to improve application availability and reliability with no manual setup or machine learning expertise.

Benefits
Automatically detect operational issues
Using machine learning, Amazon DevOps Guru automatically collects and analyzes data such as application metrics, logs, and events and identifying behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns. It automatically detects and alerts on operational issues and risks, such as impending resource exhaustion, code and configuration changes that may cause outages, memory leaks, under-provisioned compute capacity, and database I/O overutilization.
Resolve issues quickly with ML-powered insights
Amazon DevOps Guru helps reduce the time to identify and resolve the root cause of issues by by correlating anomalous behavior and operational events. When an issue occurs, DevOps Guru generates insights with a summary of related anomalies, contextual information about the issue and, when possible, it provides actionable recommendations for remediation.
Easily scale and maintain availability
Amazon DevOps Guru saves you the time and effort involved in manually updating static rules and alarms so you can effectively monitor complex and evolving applications. When you migrate or adopt new AWS services, DevOps Guru automatically analyzes their metrics, logs, and events. Then it produces insights, helping you easily adapt to changing behavior and evolving system architecture.
Reduce noise and alarm fatigue
AmazonDevOps Guru helps Developers and IT operators reduce alarm noise and overcome alarm fatigue by using pre-trained machine learning models to correlate and group related anomalies and surface the most critical alerts. With DevOps Guru, you can reduce the need to manage multiple monitoring tools and alarms, which means you can focus on the root cause of the issue and remediation.

Use cases
Operational audits
You can use Amazon DevOps Guru to get a quick summary of all the operationally significant events that have been, identified, sorted by their severity. Using the System Health Dashboard you can search for issues in specific applications, identify trends, and decide where developers should spend their time and resources.
Proactive resource exhaustion planning
Build predictive alarming for exhaustible resources such as memory, CPU, and disk space. Amazon DevOps Guru forecasts when resource utilization will exceed the provisioned capacity, and informs you by creating a notification in the dashboard, helping you avoid an impending outage.
Preventative maintenance
With Amazon DevOps Guru you can prevent incidents before they occur. DevOps Guru flags medium and low-severity findings that might not be critical, but if left alone worsen over time and affect the availability of your application. This helps you prioritize, and avoid unforeseen downtime. For example, DevOps Guru notifies you about hitting the limits of your auto scaling groups, changes in latency patterns, or increased API call volume. DevOps Guru also identifies AWS best practices to help you increase the overall availability of your application.
