Better Security and Performance with AWS VPN Innovations - AWS Online Tech Talks (35:39)
AWS Virtual Private Network solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network. AWS VPN is comprised of two services: AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN. Each service provides a highly-available, managed, and elastic cloud VPN solution to protect your network traffic.
AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted tunnels between your network and your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds or AWS Transit Gateways. For managing remote access, AWS Client VPN connects your users to AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.
AWS Client VPN
AWS Client VPN is a fully-managed, elastic VPN service that automatically scales up or down based on user demand. Because it is a cloud VPN solution, you donâ€™t need to install and manage hardware or software-based solutions, or try to estimate how many remote users to support at one time.
