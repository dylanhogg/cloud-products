AWS Well-Architected Tool
Review your architecture and adopt best practices
Get started with the AWS Well-Architected Tool
The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps you review the state of your workloads and compares them to the latest AWS architectural best practices. The tool is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructure. This Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, has been used in tens of thousands of workload reviews conducted by the AWS solutions architecture team, and provides guidance to help implement designs that scale with application needs over time.
To use this free tool, available in the AWS Management Console, just define your workload and answer a set of questions regarding operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. The AWS Well-Architected Tool then provides a plan on how to architect for the cloud using established best practices.
The AWS Well-Architected Tool now features API Access and supports building custom integrations into your applications.
Benefits
Get free architectural guidance
The AWS Well-Architected Tool gives you access to knowledge and best practices used by AWS architects, whenever you need it. You answer a series of questions about your workload, and the tool delivers an action plan with step-by-step guidance on how to build better workloads for the cloud.
Review your workloads consistently
The AWS Well-Architected Tool offers your organization a single tool and consistent process to help you review and measure your cloud architectures. When you are responsible for multiple workloads across your organization, the tool enables you to monitor their overall status and helps you to understand potential risks. Use the results that the tool provides to identify next steps for improvement, drive architectural decisions, and bring architecture considerations into your corporate governance process.
Identify and implement improvements
Use the AWS Well-Architected Tool to support continuous improvement throughout the workload lifecycle. The tool makes it easy to save point-in-time milestones and track changes to your workload. Whenever you want, initiate a new review process to help ensure your architecture continues to improve over time.

Review your workloads against current AWS best practices by answering a set of foundational questions.
Step 3: Apply best practices
The AWS Well-Architected Tool delivers a list of issues found in your workloads and step-by-step guidance to make improvements.

“The Well-Architected Framework has benefited every one of our teams who have implemented it. There were things that people didn't know they could do until we adopted it. We’re thinking about building a lasting effect with Well-Architected and making it something that engineers enjoy using constantly.”

“The Well-Architected Review process helped us see where we were on track and enabled us to check off what worked. But, more importantly, it gave us critical feedback to improve our platform since we’re always looking at how to serve our customers better.

“I definitely recommend using the Well-Architected Review to help improve your current systems. But I also recommend pulling it far into your process. Introduce it to teams earlier. If you leverage it beyond going through it with a team when they’re done, you can use it as the basis to design the application and design a truly efficient architecture upfront.”
Kevin Thorley, Enterprise Architect - Cox Automotive
