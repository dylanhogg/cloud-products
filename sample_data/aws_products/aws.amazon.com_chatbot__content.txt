LIFULL
LIFULL Co., Ltd., is a real estate-related information service and the parent company behind LIFULL HOME’S, one of Japan's largest real estate portal sites. Its businesses cover a range of different services including business support services for real estate developers, customer relationship management assistance for rental operators, local real estate information, and management of search websites for nursing homes. With a wide range of services, it is important for LIFULL’s development teams to be able to collaborate and aggregate information quickly and easily.
LIFULL chose to integrate AWS Chatbot within its Slack channels because its benefits could be realized immediately, upon setup. LIFULL now uses AWS Chatbot to aggregate various notifications such as application deployments and infrastructure provisioning through its Slack channels. Since notification destinations can be easily specified, LIFULL has been able to ensure that application notifications are distributed to each Slack channel, as appropriate, so that developers get only the information that matters to them.
“With AWS Chatbot, we’ve aggregated various notifications such as application deployments, infrastructure provisioning, and performance monitoring directly into Slack so our team can quickly take action directly from where they’re already working. Not only does this speed up our development time, but it improves the overall development experience for the team.”
Kentaro Suzuki, Solution Architect - LIFULL Co., Ltd.
