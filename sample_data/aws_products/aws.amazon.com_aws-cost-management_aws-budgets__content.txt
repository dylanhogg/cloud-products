AWS Budgets
Improve planning and cost control with flexible budgeting and forecasting
Get started with AWS Budgets
Businesses and organizations need to plan and set expectations around cloud costs. However, the cloud agility requires you to adapt your forecasting processes and tools to match the dynamic nature of your usage. Set up custom budgets and stay informed of how your cost and usage progress and respond quickly when cost or usage exceeds threshold.
AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage from the simplest to the most complex use cases. With AWS Budgets, you can choose to be alerted by email or SNS notification when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold, or when your actual RI and Savings Plans' utilization or coverage drops below your desired threshold. With AWS Budget Actions, you can also configure specific actions to respond to cost and usage status in your accounts, so that if your cost or usage exceeds or is forecasted to exceed your threshold, actions can be executed automatically or with your approval to reduce unintentional over-spending.
AWS Budgets integrates with multiple other AWS services, such as AWS Cost Explorer, so you can easily view and analyze your cost and usage drivers, AWS Chatbot, so you can receive Budget alerts in your designated Slack channel or Amazon Chime room, and AWS Service Catalog, so you can track cost on your approved AWS portfolios and products.

Benefits
Custom budgets that meet your needs
Track your cost, usage, or coverage and utilization for your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, across multiple dimensions, such as service, or Cost Categories. Aggregate your costs with an unblended or amortized view and include or exclude certain charges, such as tax and refunds. Configure your Budget Actions with IAM policies, Service Control Policies (SCPs), and targeted running instances.
Stay informed with alerts and reports
Set up event-driven alert notifications for when actual or forecasted cost or usage exceeds your budget limit, or when your RI and Savings Plans' coverage or utilization drops below your threshold. You can also choose to be informed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis with pre-scheduled Budgets Reports.
Granular budget time periods
Create annual, quarterly, monthly, or even daily budgets depending on your business needs. This allows you to take timely actions to prevent cost or usage overage, or inefficient utilization or resource coverage of your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.
Introducing auto-adjusting budgets
Dynamically set your budget amount based on historical cost or usage over a time range that you specify
