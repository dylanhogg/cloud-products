Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides an integrated experience to use OpenShift. If you are already familiar with OpenShift, you can accelerate your application development process by leveraging familiar OpenShift APIs and tools for deployments on AWS. With ROSA, you can use the wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to build secure and scalable applications faster. ROSA comes with pay-as-you-go hourly and annual billing, a 99.95% SLA, and joint support from AWS and Red Hat.
