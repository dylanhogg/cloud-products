Analyze all of your data
No other data warehouse makes it as easy to gain new insights from all your data. With Redshift, you can query and combine exabytes of structured and semi-structured data across your data warehouse, operational database, and data lake using standard SQL. Redshift lets you easily save the results of your queries back to your S3 data lake using open formats, like Apache Parquet, so that you can do additional analytics from other analytics services like Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and Amazon SageMaker.

Performance at any scale
Amazon Redshift has up to 3x better price-performance than other cloud data warehouses, and the price-performance advantage improves as your data warehouse grows from gigabytes to exabytes.
Amazon Redshift takes advantage of AWS designed-hardware and machine learning (ML) to deliver the best price performance at any scale. This includes using the AWS Nitro System to accelerate data compression and encryption, ML techniques to analyze queries, and graph optimization algorithms to automatically organize and store data for faster query results.
