Deepest integration with your data lake and AWS services
No other data warehouse makes it as easy to gain new insights from all your data. With Redshift you can query petabytes of structured and semi-structured data across your data warehouse, operational database, and your data lake using standard SQL. Redshift lets you easily save the results of your queries back to your S3 data lake using open formats like Apache Parquet to further analyze from other analytics services like Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and Amazon SageMaker.
"By leveraging Redshift Spectrum's ability to query data directly into our Amazon S3 data lake, we have been able to easily integrate new data sources in hours, not days or weeks.  This has not only reduced our time to insight, but helped us control our infrastructure costs."
- Elliott Cordo
VP of Data Analytics, Equinox Fitness
