Getting Started
Q: How do I get started with AWS DeepRacer simulator?
The
AWS DeepRacer simulator provides a tutorial to get you started with reinforcement learning and training your first model. You will then also be able to evaluate and tune your models, before racing them in the AWS DeepRacer League. The AWS DeepRacer Developer Documentation provides additional details on
building your first model and also
how to improve your models.
Q: How can customers get started with multi-car racing and object avoidance?
Customers can login into the
AWS DeepRacer console from anywhere in the world. Here they can experiment with new sensor configurations in the Garage section of the console and build reinforcement learning models for head to head and object avoidance racing.
Q: How can I start my own Community Race?
Customers can create their own virtual races the Community Races section of the
AWS DeepRacer console.
Q: Do I need an AWS DeepRacer car in order to use the AWS DeepRacer simulator? No. You can train models, evaluate them without owning an AWS DeepRacer car. Furthermore, you can race your models in both the AWS DeepRacer League Virtual and Summit Circuits without owning an AWS DeepRacer car.
Q: Does my DeepRacer need to be connected to the internet to race autonomously? No. AWS DeepRacer uses the deployed RL model and input from the camera to run inference locally. AWS DeepRacer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device used to start and stop autonomous driving. Details on how to set up your vehicle can be found in the Developer Documentation.

AWS DeepRacer Student League Beta
Q: Where can I find more details regarding the AWS DeepRacer Student League?
[Link to official rules]
Q: Does it cost anything to compete in the AWS DeepRacer Student League? There is no cost to sign up to participate in the AWS DeepRacer League. To compete in the league, you will train reinforcement learning models in the AWS console using your AWS Academy provided account. Each AWS academy student account will receive $100 in service credit which can be utilized to for console training and storage. There is no cost to submit models to the race.
Q: Does it cost my school anything to participate in the AWS DeepRacer Student League?
No. All AWS Academy member institution approved educators may use AWS Academy foundation services to generate a lab and provide AWS credits to their students at no cost.
Q: My School is not an AWS Academy member institution, can I still compete in the AWS DeepRacer Student League? If you are interested in participating in the AWS DeepRacer Student League race, we encourage you to speak to a faculty member about joining AWS Academy and ask them to submit an application on behalf of your institution. There is no cost to apply, and schools can be approved to join AWS Academy in as little as one day. At this time, all AWS DeepRacer Student league participants must attend AWS Academy member institutions to receive $100 AWS credits. Full time students on Non AWS Academy higher education institutions in North America that wish to participate may create an AWS DeepRacer account to do so, but will not benefit from $100 AWS credits via AWS Academy. All eligible participants must have a valid .edu address associated with their AWS account, subject to verification.
Q: How will I know if I qualified for the championship? Championship finalist teams will be contacted on Nov. 1, 2021 via the email address associated with their AWS account. Aliases of the qualifying racers and teams will be published to aws/amazon.com/deepracer/studentleague by November 2, 2021.
Q: Do I need to work together with other students at my school to join a team?  Collaborating with other students is not required, as the three students with the fastest qualifying times from each school will automatically be considered a team and be contacted to advance. However, we recommend working with your educator to find other students from your school to work with to improve your models and help your team qualify for the Championship Finale.
Q: What if there are multiple educators at my school working with students on AWS DeepRacer? We recommend you connect with your AWS Academy Central Point of Contact at your institution as well as your department to verify if other educators have already formed an AWS Academy Learner Lab for students to compete. There is no limit to the number of labs per school that may be created by educators to enable students to participate, but only one educator of the winning school will be eligible to win a trip with the team to the championships. If an educator cannot be appointed internally, the educator with the top performing student from a given school in their learner lab will be assumed the team coach.

Q: If I already own an AWS DeepRacer car will it be able to master multi-car racing and object avoidance?
Developers who already own a DeepRacer car can buy an easy-to-install sensor kit from Amazon.com to give their car the same capabilities as AWS DeepRacer Evo.
Q: What does the LIDAR and stereo camera do?
LIDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It provides a continuous light beam providing the reinforcement model with inputs about whether a car is fast approaching from behind. The stereo camera adds depth perception to allow the car to detect objects in the road and be more responsive to its environment. Combining these sensory inputs with advanced algorithms, and updated reward functions, developers can build models that will not only detect obstacles (including other cars), but will also decide when to overtake to beat the other car to the finish line.
Q: Which AWS services are integrated with AWS DeepRacer? AWS DeepRacer integrates with Amazon SageMaker for reinforcement learning model training, AWS RoboMaker to provide the racing simulator, Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for video streaming of virtual simulation footage, Amazon S3 for model storage, and Amazon CloudWatch for log capture.
Q: How do I add new tracks to the AWS DeepRacer simulator? Currently, developers cannot add additional tracks to the AWS DeepRacer simulator. AWS DeepRacer will release a number of new racing tracks throughout 2021.
Q: Can I train my models on the AWS DeepRacer device? No. Training an RL model requires feedback regarding the outcome of actions taken by the model. This feedback loop exists in the AWS DeepRacer simulator, but not in the real-world.
Q: Can I train my models locally on my own machine as opposed to the AWS Cloud? Currently AWS DeepRacer does not support local training.
Q: Can I train AWS DeepRacer RL models directly on Amazon SageMaker? Yes. You can use the AWS DeepRacer Distributed Training SageMaker Notebook to create and train RL models. You will be able to deploy these models to your AWS DeepRacer manually, but won’t yet be able to import them into the AWS DeepRacer console.
