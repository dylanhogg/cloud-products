Getting Started
Q: How do I get started with AWS DeepRacer simulator?
The
AWS DeepRacer simulator provides a tutorial to get you started with reinforcement learning and training your first model. You will then also be able to evaluate and tune your models, before racing them in the AWS DeepRacer League. The AWS DeepRacer Developer Documentation provides additional details on
building your first model and also
how to improve your models.
Q: How can customers get started with multi-car racing and object avoidance?
Customers can login into the
AWS DeepRacer console from anywhere in the world. Here they can experiment with new sensor configurations in the Garage section of the console and build reinforcement learning models for head to head and object avoidance racing.
Q: How can I start my own Community Race?
Customers can create their own virtual races the Community Races section of the
AWS DeepRacer console.
Q: Do I need an AWS DeepRacer car in order to use the AWS DeepRacer simulator? No. You can train models, evaluate them without owning an AWS DeepRacer car. Furthermore, you can race your models in both the AWS DeepRacer League Virtual and Summit Circuits without owning an AWS DeepRacer car.
Q: Does my DeepRacer need to be connected to the internet to race autonomously? No. AWS DeepRacer uses the deployed RL model and input from the camera to run inference locally. AWS DeepRacer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device used to start and stop autonomous driving. Details on how to set up your vehicle can be found in the Developer Documentation.
AWS DeepRacer League
Q: How do I race in the DeepRacer League?
Join the AWS DeepRacer League from anywhere in the world via the AWS DeepRacer console and put your skills to the test on virtual tracks monthly. Race for prizes and glory and a chance to advance to compete in the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup.
New for 2021 Developers will start in the Open Division of the league. Each month the top 10% in the Open Division will advance to the Pro Division the folowing month.The top 16 racers at the end of the monthly Pro Division race qualify for the Pro Finale, where they will race live to determine the winners for that month. The top 10 in the Pro Finale receive AWS DeepRacer Evo devices, while the top 3 will be eligible to receive an expenses-paid trip to advance to compete in the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup at re:Invent.
Q: How many times can I enter the League? There is no limit on the number of races or race formats you can enter, in-person or virtually. In fact, participating in multiple racing events, increases your chances of winning one of the prizes to advance to compete for the Championship Cup.
Q: What are the prizes? Details of the AWS DeepRacer League prizes can be found here. For full details please read the AWS DeepRacer League Terms and Conditions.
Q: Do I have to build my own model to race? No, you do not need to build your own model to compete in the AWS DeepRacer League. There are tutorials inside the AWS DeepRacer simulator on how to build your own model, as well as pre-trained sample models you can use to get started.
Q: How much time do you get to race on a track in the Summit Circuit? You have three minutes on the track to attempt to get a valid lap time and enter the leaderboard. Intime trial racing, a valid lap is one where your car can complete a lap around the track without goingoff the track more than three times. In head-to-head racing, a valid lap is one where your car can complete a lap before our AWS DeepRacer X bot car crosses the finish line. Full rules can be foundin the AWS DeepRacer League Terms and Conditions.
Q: How long does a Virtual Circuit race last? Each virtual race will last one month (from the 1st business day of the month to the last day of the month).
Q: How many Virtual Circuit races are there? Starting on March 1st, the Virtual Circuit will have 8 monthly races, with three racing formats in each(time trial, object avoidance, and head-to-head). Each race will be revealed in the console on thefirst business day of each month leading up to re:Invent 2021 (March – October).

Q: What does the LIDAR and stereo camera do?
LIDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It provides a continuous light beam providing the reinforcement model with inputs about whether a car is fast approaching from behind. The stereo camera adds depth perception to allow the car to detect objects in the road and be more responsive to its environment. Combining these sensory inputs with advanced algorithms, and updated reward functions, developers can build models that will not only detect obstacles (including other cars), but will also decide when to overtake to beat the other car to the finish line.
Q: Which AWS services are integrated with AWS DeepRacer? AWS DeepRacer integrates with Amazon SageMaker for reinforcement learning model training, AWS RoboMaker to provide the racing simulator, Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for video streaming of virtual simulation footage, Amazon S3 for model storage, and Amazon CloudWatch for log capture.
Q: How do I add new tracks to the AWS DeepRacer simulator? Currently, developers cannot add additional tracks to the AWS DeepRacer simulator. AWS DeepRacer will release a number of new racing tracks throughout 2021.
Q: Can I train my models on the AWS DeepRacer device? No. Training an RL model requires feedback regarding the outcome of actions taken by the model. This feedback loop exists in the AWS DeepRacer simulator, but not in the real-world.
Q: Can I train my models locally on my own machine as opposed to the AWS Cloud? Currently AWS DeepRacer does not support local training.
Q: Can I train AWS DeepRacer RL models directly on Amazon SageMaker? Yes. You can use the AWS DeepRacer Distributed Training SageMaker Notebook to create and train RL models. You will be able to deploy these models to your AWS DeepRacer manually, but won’t yet be able to import them into the AWS DeepRacer console.
