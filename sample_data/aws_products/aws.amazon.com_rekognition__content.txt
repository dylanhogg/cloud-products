Benefits
Automate visual analysis tasks at scale
With Amazon Rekognition, you can tackle tasks that cannot be performed manually such as analyzing millions of images and videos within minutes. You can also increase workforce productivity and minimize errors by augmenting cumbersome, repetitive human visual review tasks with machine learning.
Get started without ML expertise
With Amazon Rekognition, you can quickly add a wide range of pre-trained computer vision APIs to your applications within hours, without the need to collect data and build computer vision models from scratch. If you have unique requirements, you can use AutoML to automatically train & host custom ML models by uploading as few as ten labeled images.
Reduce ML infrastructure costs
Amazon Rekognition is a fully managed service that can automatically scale up and down based on your business needs. You don’t need to build and manage your own ML infrastructure. You can quickly deliver reliable, scalable, and secure applications powered by computer vision and pay only for the images and videos that you analyze.
Key features
Labels
With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify thousands of objects (such as bike, telephone, building), and scenes (such as parking lot, beach, city). When analyzing video, you can also identify specific activities such as "delivering a package" or "playing soccer". Learn more
Custom labels
With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can extend the detection capabilities of Amazon Rekognition to extract information from images that is uniquely helpful to your business. For example, you can find your corporate logo in social media, identify your products on store shelves, classify your machine parts in an assembly line, or detect your animated characters in videos.

Use Amazon A2I to enhance the accuracy of Amazon Rekognition image moderation predictions using human review. Learn more
Text detection
In photos and videos, text appears very differently than neat words on a printed page. Amazon Rekognition can read skewed and distorted text to capture information like store names, forced narratives overlaid on media, street signs, and text on product packaging. Learn more
Face detection and analysis
With Amazon Rekognition, you can easily detect when faces appear in images and videos and get attributes such as gender, age range, eyes open, glasses, facial hair for each. In video, you can also measure how these face attributes change over time, such as constructing a timeline of the emotions expressed by an actor. Learn more
Face search and verification
Amazon Rekognition provides fast and accurate face search, allowing you to identify a person in a photo or video using your private repository of face images. You can also verify identity by analyzing a face image against images you have stored for comparison. Learn more
Celebrity recognition
You can quickly identify well known people in your video and image libraries to catalog footage and photos for marketing, advertising, and media industry use cases. Learn more
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection
With Amazon Rekognition, you can analyze images from your on-premises cameras at scale to automatically detect if persons in images are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as face covers (face masks), hand covers (gloves), and head covers (helmets) and whether the protective equipment covers the corresponding body part (nose for face covers, head for head covers, and hands for hand covers).

Use cases
Media Analysis
Streamline media analysis tasks by automating the detection of black frames, end credits, shot changes, and color bars. By automating these tasks, you can reduce the time, effort, and costs associated with workflows like video ad insertion, content operations, and content production. Learn more
Make content searchable
Amazon Rekognition automatically extracts metadata from your image and video files, capturing objects, faces, text and more. This metadata can be used to easily search your images and videos with keywords, or to find the right assets for content syndication.
Flag inappropriate content
With Amazon Rekognition you can automatically flag inappropriate content, such as nudity, graphic violence or weapons, in images and videos. Using the detailed metadata returned, you can create your own rules based on what is considered appropriate for the culture and demographics of your users. Learn more
Enable digital identity verification
Using Amazon Rekognition, you can create scalable authentication workflows for automated payments and other identity verification scenarios. Amazon Rekognition lets you easily perform face verification for opted-in users by comparing a photo or selfie with an identifying document such a driver's license.
Workplace Safety
Automate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection at scale to improve workplace safety practices and to better comply with occupational safety and health regulations. With Amazon Rekognition, you can analyze images from your on-premises cameras at scale to detect if persons in images are wearing PPE such as face covers, hand covers, and head covers. Learn more
Identify products, landmarks and brands
App developers can use Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels to identify specific items in social media and photo apps. For example, you could train a custom model to identify famous landmarks in a city to provide tourists with information about its history, operating hours, and ticket prices by simply taking a photo.
