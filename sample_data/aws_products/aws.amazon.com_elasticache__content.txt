Customers
Learn how The Pokémon Company moved user caching to Amazon ElastiCache, taking advantage of both Redis and Memcached. Redis queues tasks for new users, so they can be prompted to complete post-authentication tasks such as accepting terms and conditions. Memcached helps keep tickets live so that existing users’ sessions are not interrupted when new users join.
