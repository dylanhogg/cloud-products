How it works
Benefits
Easily deliver targeted ads to any platform
AWS Elemental MediaTailor makes it easy to personalize ads for users across different devices from a single ad monetization service. Targeting criteria can be set up to fetch personalized ad content from the ad decision server which makes the determination about which ads to send based on viewer, time, and content. Support for popular ad insertion protocols gives you the flexibility to serve individual ads or groups of ads based on your specific business needs.
Improve viewing experiences
Inserting advertising into content streams as viewers play them allows you to match the quality and format of your advertising to your video content stream. Unlike other approaches to ad insertion that can cause ads to play with variable quality, AWS Elemental MediaTailor ensures the video quality of both your ads and of your core content are the same. This gives your viewers an experience that is superior to other streaming video ad solutions.
Increase the accuracy of ad view reporting
AWS Elemental MediaTailor lets you increase the accuracy of ad tracking by capturing data directly from the viewing device, reducing the effects of ad blocking software and adhering to established advertising industry standards. Other approaches often fail to accurately capture viewing behavior due to ad blocking software, lack of support for certain devices, or dependence on inadequate third-party tools for tracking. With AWS Elemental MediaTailor, ad impressions and viewing behavior are accurately measured across web, iOS, Android, and other connected viewing devices, helping you more effectively measure the revenue impact of every ad delivered.
