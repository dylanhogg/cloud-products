General
Q: What is AWS Fargate?
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). AWS Fargate makes it easy to focus on building your applications. Fargate eliminates the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.

Q: Why should I use AWS Fargate?
AWS Fargate enables you to focus on your applications. You define your application content, networking, storage, and scaling requirements. There is no provisioning, patching, cluster capacity management, or infrastructure management required.
Q: What use cases does AWS Fargate support?
AWS Fargate supports all of the common container use cases including microservices architecture applications, batch processing, machine learning applications, and migrating on-premises applications to the cloud.
Q: What is the pricing of AWS Fargate?
With AWS Fargate, you pay only for the amount of vCPU, memory, and storage resources consumed by your containerized applications.
vCPU and memory resources are calculated from the time your container images are pulled until the Amazon ECS task or EKS pod terminates, rounded up to the nearest second. A minimum charge of 1 minute applies. 20 GB of ephemeral storage is available for all Fargate Tasks and Pods by defaultâ€”you only pay for any additional storage that you configure.
Fargate supports Spot and Compute Savings Plan pricing options just like with Amazon EC2 instances. You can find additional details on the pricing page.
Q: How does AWS Fargate work with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS?
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service. Both ECS and EKS use containers provisioned by Fargate to automatically scale, load balance, and optimize container availability through managed scheduling, providing an easier way to build and operate containerized applications.
Q: How should I choose when to use AWS Fargate?
Choose AWS Fargate for its isolation model and security. You should also select Fargate if you want to launch containers without having to provision or manage EC2 instances. If you require greater control of your EC2 instances or broader customization options, then use ECS or EKS without Fargate. Use EC2 for GPU workloads, which are not supported on Fargate today.
Q: Are there any differences in feature support for AWS Fargate support on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS?
Our goal is to keep the features consistent across the two orchestrators. However, at a given time, there could be some gaps due to feature deployment timelines.
