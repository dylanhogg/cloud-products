General
Q: What is AWS Launch Wizard?
A: AWS Launch Wizard is a console-based service to quickly and easily size, configure, and deploy third-party applications on AWS without the need to identify and provision individual AWS resources.
Q: Why should I use AWS Launch Wizard?
A: AWS Launch Wizard offers you an easy way to deploy enterprise applications and optimize costs. Instead of selecting and configuring separate infrastructure services, you go through a few steps in AWS Launch Wizard and it deploys a ready-to-use application on your behalf. It reduces the time you need to spend on investigating how to provision, cost and configure your application on AWS. AWS Launch Wizard determines the right instance type, EBS volumes, and other resources to match your application requirements such as performance, memory, and bandwidth. You also have the ability to modify the recommended defaults, and see an updated cost assessment. AWS Launch Wizard provides you with custom CloudFormation templates that can serve as a baseline for your subsequent application deployments.
Q: Which third-party applications does AWS Launch Wizard support?
A: AWS Launch Wizard supports SQL Server deployments on Microsoft Windows and Linux, Active Directory, and SAP.
Q: How much does AWS Launch Wizard cost?
A: There is no additional charge for using AWS Launch Wizard. You only pay for AWS resources that are provisioned for running your application, such as Amazon EC2 instances and EBS volumes.
Q: Can I use AWS Launch Wizard to modify application resources after deployment?
A: No. If you need to modify resources post-deployment, you can use the service console for that resource. For example, to modify EC2 instances, you would use the EC2 Console.
Q: If I modify application resources after deployment, would AWS Launch Wizard detect those changes?
A: No. AWS Launch Wizard is a provisioning tool and does not manage the application lifecycle beyond the initial deployment. To make changes or track the status of resources after they have been provisioned, you can use other AWS services such as AWS Systems Manager and the EC2 Console.
Q: Can I delete the resources provisioned through AWS Launch Wizard after deployment?
A: Yes. You have the option to delete your provisioned resources from the summary screen on AWS Launch Wizard.
Q: How do I patch and monitor the application post deployment?
A: You can patch the application resources through AWS Systems Manager and monitor it through Amazon CloudWatch.
Q: How do I discover applications that I have deployed through AWS Launch Wizard in the past?
A: Each time you launch AWS Launch Wizard, it shows you a historical list of applications that you deployed using AWS Launch Wizard. When you click on an existing application, the wizard takes you to its summary page, which contains access information such as IP address and resource group name.
Q: What IAM role do I require for using AWS Launch Wizard?
A: For the very first access on an account, you will need a one-time setup of the IAM user policy as described in the documentation. Then you can continue to use these user credentials to log in to the Launch Wizard.
Q: What IAM policy does AWS Launch Wizard carry during deployment?
A: AWS Launch Wizard assumes the IAM role to create, describe, tag, modify, or delete resources on your behalf during deployment.
Q: How is AWS Launch Wizard different from AWS CloudFormation?
A: AWS Launch Wizard leverages AWS CloudFormation and provides a deployment option to customers who prefer guided UI-driven experience. AWS Launch Wizard provides you a guided point-and-click experience to deploy applications. You answer a few high-level questions about your application requirements on the console, and then AWS Launch Wizard handles the end-to-end sizing, cost estimation, provisioning and configuration of your application. CloudFormation allows you to programmatically deploy resources on AWS by manual code creation.
Q: How is AWS Launch Wizard different from AWS Quick Starts?
A: AWS Quick Starts are deployment accelerators that reduce hundreds of manual procedures into a select few that allow you to quickly create deployments through a command line interface. AWS Launch Wizard offers you a complete UI-driven guided experience for deploying production-ready applications on AWS with added benefits of resource sizing, customizable deployments, application configuration and cost estimation.
Q: Does AWS Launch Wizard provide estimates of the AWS services that it launches?
A: AWS Launch Wizard provides estimates for the EC2 instances and the EBS volumes that are launched based on the configuration that users selects. These costs are estimates based on on-demand pricing and do not include support and any applicable AWS marketplace costs.
Microsoft SQL Server
Q: How do I get started with AWS Launch Wizard for SQL Server?
A: You can use AWS Launch Wizard in the following three steps:
Step 1: Launch AWS Launch Wizard from https://aws.amazon.com/launchwizard or from the AWS console. Select SQL Server from the options menu.
Step 2: Enter your SQL Server specifications, such as application name, SQL Server version, number of nodes, throughput, high-availability cluster etc. You also need to specify your Active Directory and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) preferences.
Step 3: AWS Launch Wizard recommends the most appropriate resources based on your input specifications and shows you an estimated cost. You can edit these resources to suit your preferences and get an updated cost estimate. Once you finalize the resources, AWS Launch Wizard deploys them and configures your application.
Post deployment, you can use the EC2 Console to access your deployed resources. Similarly, you can manage your application through AWS Systems Manager, monitor it through Amazon CloudWatch, and govern IT policies through AWS Service Catalog.
Q: Can I bring my own SQL Server licenses (BYOL) for deployments through AWS Launch Wizard?
A: Yes. AWS Launch Wizard enables you to bring your own SQL Server licenses through the use of custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
Q: How can I track the SQL Server licenses that I am deploying through AWS Launch Wizard?
A: You can use AWS License Manager to manage licenses in AWS and on-premises servers from software vendors such as Microsoft. AWS License Manager lets administrators create customized licensing rules that emulate the terms of their licensing agreements, and then enforces these rules when an instance of EC2 gets launched from AWS Launch Wizard.
Q: Does the SQL Server Always On availability group application deployed through AWS Launch Wizard get joined to my Active Directory (AD) domain?
A: Yes. When deploying SQL Server Always On through AWS Launch Wizard, we ask for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain credentials and domain. With these credentials, we can enable you to join the application to your AWS Managed AD account. If you donâ€™t have an existing AWS Managed Microsoft AD account, Launch Wizard provides you with the option to create one during deployment. You can also join your domain for SQL Server deployments to your on-premises Active Directory.

Microsoft Active Directory
Q: How does AWS Launch Wizard deploy Active Directory infrastructure?
AWS Launch Wizard applies AWS Well-Architected Framework to guide you through setting up a new Active Directory infrastructure, or adding domain controllers to an existing infrastructure, either in AWS Cloud or on premises. The deployment environment includes existing VPCs, security groups, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. You can set up a new Active Directory infrastructure with two to three domain controllers, or you can add up to three domain controllers to your existing Active Directory infrastructure for each AWS Region. Launch Wizard reduces the time that it takes to set up an Active Directory infrastructure and deploy self-managed domain controllers to the cloud or on premises.
Q: How is AWS Launch Wizard for Active Directory different from AWS Directory Services?
AWS Directory Service lets you run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as a managed service, without the hassle of managing your own AD infrastructure. However, for cases where you have to run your own AD infrastructure, you can use AWS Launch Wizard to simplify the deployment process.
