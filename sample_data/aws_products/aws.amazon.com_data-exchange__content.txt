AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. Qualified data providers include category-leading brands such as Reuters, who curate data from over 2.2 million unique news stories per year in multiple languages; Change Healthcare, who process and anonymize more than 14 billion healthcare transactions and $1 trillion in claims annually; Dun & Bradstreet, who maintain a database of more than 330 million global business records; and Foursquare, whose location data is derived from 220 million unique consumers and includes more than 60 million global commercial venues.

For example, property insurers can subscribe to data to analyze historical weather patterns to calibrate insurance coverage requirements in different geographies; restaurants can subscribe to population and location data to identify optimal regions for expansion; academic researchers can conduct studies on climate change by subscribing to data on carbon dioxide emissions; and healthcare professionals can subscribe to aggregated data from historical clinical trials to accelerate their research activities.
For data providers, AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to reach the millions of AWS customers migrating to the cloud by removing the need to build and maintain infrastructure for data storage, delivery, billing, and entitling.

Benefits
Quickly find diverse data in one place
AWS Data Exchange has hundreds of commercial data products from category-leading data providers across industries such as financial services, healthcare, retail, media & entertainment, and more. AWS Data Exchange includes hundreds of free data sets too, including data collected from popular public sources as well as trials for commercial products, so customers can explore before they subscribe. You can easily find and subscribe to data products in AWS Marketplace and stay up-to-date as providers publish new revisions in a consistent and cloud-native way.
Efficiently access data in the cloud
AWS Data Exchange removes the friction of finding, licensing, and using data sets. Without AWS Data Exchange, you might spend days or even weeks licensing data and moving it where you need it to power your analytics. AWS Data Exchange simplifies access to data — eliminating the need to receive physical media, manage FTP credentials, or integrate with different APIs from multiple providers. When providers publish updates to their data sets, you will receive a notification so you can automatically consume new data as it’s published.
Easily analyze new data
AWS Data Exchange enables you to immediately use data you subscribe to with the full portfolio of AWS analytics services, like big data processing with Amazon EMR, data warehousing with Amazon Redshift, ad-hoc query with Amazon Athena, data integration and ETL with AWS Glue, and building data lakes with AWS Lake Formation. You can quickly copy data to Amazon S3 and immediately transform and process it, analyze it, or build machine learning models on it.

Use cases
Financial services
Banks, insurers, and asset managers can use AWS Data Exchange to subscribe to products containing market data, news archives, compensation benchmarks, industry profiles, company sentiments, and more. These customers can seamlessly integrate the data they subscribe to with their own data to power the portfolio risk modeling, trading strategies, and advisory services they are migrating to the cloud. Customers can also combine these traditional financial data sources with alternative (non-financial) data sets such as places of interest visitation and aggregated demographics data.
Consumer & retail
Consumer & retail companies can use AWS Data Exchange to find and subscribe to a range of location, movement, weather, and industry profiling data. They can then combine it with their own data to better understand shopper segmentation, improve channel strategy, expand product offerings, and optimize marketing campaigns. For example, retailers can use aggregated demographics and visitation data to size target market segments and identify where to invest in more retail locations. Retailers can also use weather forecast data to anticipate customer needs and optimize inventory planning. Visitation data can also help retailers adjust staffing levels to meet fluctuations in demand for their retail locations.
Healthcare & life sciences
Pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and health insurers can better plan clinical trials, build insurance plans, research new drugs, and improve patient lives by combining their own data with products they subscribe to on AWS Data Exchange. Some relevant products contain data on drug switching patterns, fitness benchmarks, life expectancy benchmarks, aggregated claims data, and more.
