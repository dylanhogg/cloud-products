Amazon Comprehend
Discover insights and relationships in text
Get started with Amazon Comprehend
Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. Instead of combing through documents, the process is simplified and unseen information is easier to understand.
The service can identify critical elements in data, including references to language, people, and places, and the text files can be categorized by relevant topics. In real time, you can automatically and accurately detect customer sentiment in your content. This accelerates more informed, real-time decision making to improve customer experiences. Comprehend not only locates any content that contains personally identifiable information, it also redacts and masks that content. Comprehend is fully managed, so you can get up and running quickly, without having to train models from scratch. Start processing millions of documents in minutes by leveraging the power of machine learning.

Benefits
Uncover valuable insights from your text
Amazon Comprehend can uncover the meaning and relationships in text from customer support incidents, product reviews, social media feeds, news articles, documents, and other sources. For example, you can identify the feature that’s most often mentioned when customers are happy or unhappy about your product.
Organize documents by topics
Amazon Comprehend can be trained to label documents with topics or tags defined by you. Natural Language Processing techniques enables the solution to go beyond keyword search or rules-based tagging for more accurate document classification. Deliver personalized content to your customers and provide richer navigation based on these topics.
Train models on your own data
Amazon Comprehend can also be used to identify specific terms. You can tailor the classification messages and documents to your organization’s needs, such as social media posts by product. Machine learning expertise is not a requirement to add this customization. It’s as simple as providing the labels and a small set of examples of each.
Support for general and industry specific text
Powered by state-of-the-art machine learning models, Amazon Comprehend can identify industry-specific insights from unstructured text and documents, like emails. Amazon Comprehend Medical can identify medical information, such as medication and medical conditions, from a variety of sources (including doctor’s notes), and determine their relationship to each other. It enables easier analysis and provides context, to make extracted terms meaningful.

Chisel AI helps commercial insurance carriers and brokers double their business by automating mundane underwriting and brokering processes.
The commercial insurance industry operates using processes that are document intensive. Processing these documents requires manual entry, is costly, and prone to human error. We use AWS services to automate and streamline operational workflows, using Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend. Using machine learning we have been able to extract policy numbers, expiration dates, and many more insurance industry-specific attributes with reduced manual effort. We leverage Amazon Textract to extract data from documents at scale and Amazon Comprehend to classify and label unstructured content in documents and pull out insurance-specific entities. “Our applications use Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend in conjunction with our own proprietary models to automate costly manual processes like document review and insurance application intake. We reduce customer effort, making it faster and easier to buy and sell commercial insurance. We are seeing great results using AWS machine learning.”
