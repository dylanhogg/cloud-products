General
Q: What is Amazon DevOps Guru?  A: Amazon DevOps Guru is a service powered by machine learning (ML) that is designed to make it easy to improve an application’s operational performance and availability. DevOps Guru helps detect behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns so you can identify operational issues long before they impact your customers. DevOps Guru uses ML models informed by years of Amazon.com and AWS operational excellence to help identify anomalous application behavior (for example, increased latency, error rates, resource constraints, and others) and surface critical issues that could cause potential outages or service disruptions. When DevOps Guru identifies a critical issue, it automatically sends an alert and provides a summary of related anomalies, the likely root cause, and context for when and where the issue occurred. When possible, DevOps Guru is designed to also provide recommendations on how to remediate the issue.  Q: Why should I use Amazon DevOps Guru? A: Amazon DevOps Guru is designed to save you hours—if not days—of time and effort spent detecting, debugging, and resolving operational issues, enabling you to effectively monitor complex and evolving applications. It helps avoid common oversights and errors in monitoring, such as missing alarms, which cause application downtime. When operational issues occur, DevOps Guru saves debugging time by fetching relevant and specific information from a large number of data sources. DevOps Guru generates operational insights to alert you of the issue, with a summary of related anomalies, contextual information about why and when the issue occurred, along with recommendations on how to remediate issues and reduce application downtime.
Q: How does Amazon DevOps Guru work? A: Amazon DevOps Guru’s ML models benefit from more than 20 years of operational expertise in building, scaling, and maintaining universally available applications for Amazon.com. DevOps Guru is designed to automatically ingest and analyze metrics like latency, error rates, and request rates for all resources to establish normal operating bounds. DevOps Guru then uses a pre-trained ML model to identify deviations from the established baseline. When it identifies anomalous application behavior like increased latency, error rates, or resource constraints that could cause potential outages or service disruptions, it alerts operators with issue details like the resources involved, the issue timeline, and other related events to help them quickly understand the potential impact and likely causes of the issue. It is also designed to provide options for remediation or mitigation. Developers can then use those suggestions from DevOps Guru to reduce time to resolution when issues arise and improve application availability and reliability with no manual configuration setup—and with no ML expertise required. DevOps Guru can be used as a standalone service, and also integrates with partner applications from PagerDuty and Atlassian along with AWS System Manager OpsCenter.
Q: How can I get started with Amazon DevOps Guru? A: With a few clicks, you can enable Amazon DevOps Guru in the AWS Management Console. DevOps Guru provides you with an onboarding wizard that helps you quickly configure the analysis coverage for your AWS resources. Once enabled, DevOps Guru is designed to continuously analyze the operational data for your AWS resources based on your selection and produces insights whenever it detects ongoing or emergent operational issues.
Q: How do I specify the AWS resources for DevOps Guru to analyze? A: You can choose your analysis coverage boundary to be your entire AWS account or, you can prescribe the specific AWS CloudFormation stacks that you want DevOps Guru to analyze, or use AWS tags to create the resource grouping you want DevOps Guru to analyze. Based on your selection, DevOps Guru analyzes the operational data for all supported AWS resources in the chosen coverage boundary.
When you add new resources to your coverage boundary selection, DevOps Guru automatically starts analyzing the additional resources. Similarly, DevOps Guru stops analyzing and billing any resources when you remove them from your account or CloudFormation stack.
Q: What types of issues can Amazon DevOps Guru detect? A: Amazon DevOps Guru is designed to automatically detect operational issues like missing or misconfigured alarms, early warning of resource exhaustion, and code and configuration changes that could lead to outages. DevOps Guru uses ML to correlate anomalies in metrics with operational events and provides you with contextual insights to help you focus on the right remediation steps. DevOps Guru also correlates and groups related application and infrastructure metrics like web application latency spikes, running out of disk space, bad code deployments, or memory leaks to reduce false and redundant alarms so you can focus on high-severity issues.
Q: What monitoring services does Amazon DevOps Guru work with? A: At launch, Amazon DevOps Guru can use data from Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, AWS System Manager OpsCenter, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS X-Ray. Amazon DevOps Guru is also integrated with partner operations monitoring and incident management solutions like Atlassian OpsGenie and Pager Duty.
Q: How does Amazon DevOps Guru work with other related operational services, such as AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter? A: If you use AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter, Amazon DevOps Guru operational insights can be surfaced directly within the OpsCenter dashboard as OpsItems.
Q: How does Amazon DevOps Guru protect my operational data? A: Amazon DevOps Guru uses encryption in transit and at rest to protect your content during ingestion and data analysis.
Q: Where did AWS obtain the training data to build this service? A: Our training data was generated by internal AWS services and infrastructure.
Operational Insights
Q: What is an Amazon DevOps Guru Operational Insight? A: Amazon DevOps Guru operational insights aggregate the information needed to investigate and remediate an operational issue directly in the DevOps Guru console. An insight is composed of three main sections. It highlights the anomalous metrics related to the operational issue, with graphs to easily visualize abnormal system and application behavior. The insight also includes contextual information such as relevant events and log snippets so you can easily understand the scope and issue timeline. Operational Insights also include recommendations on actions you can take to remediate the issue.
Q: Can I integrate Amazon DevOps Guru into my existing ticket/incident management system?  A: You can configure Amazon DevOps Guru to create an OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter for each insight that it generates. You also can configure DevOps Guru to deliver its insights via AWS SNS, which you can consume into incident management tools such PagerDuty and Atlassian.
Q: After enabling the service, when will I see operational insights?  A: Once enabled, Amazon DevOps starts baselining your application, which may range from minutes to an hour depending on the number of resources being analyzed. After baselining, DevOps Guru will analyze your resources continuously and produces insights when it detects anomalous behavior.
