Benefits
Deliver desktop applications to any computer
Users can access the desktop applications they need at any time. AppStream 2.0 streams your applications from AWS to any computer, including Chromebooks, Macs, and PCs.
Scale without infrastructure
AppStream 2.0 is fully managed on AWS and globally available with pay-as-you-go pricing. You can easily scale your application streaming to any number of users across the globe without acquiring, provisioning, and operating hardware or infrastructure.
Secure applications and data
Applications and data are not stored on users' computers. Your applications are streamed as encrypted pixels and access data secured within your network. AppStream 2.0 runs on AWS, so you benefit from a data center and network architecture built for the most security-sensitive organizations.
Provide a fluid and responsive user experience
Applications are highly responsive because they run on virtual machines and the NICE DCV protocol automatically adjust each streaming session to network conditions for a fluid user experience. Your users can run multiple applications and easily switch and interact with them through an application centric view or a standard desktop experience. Users can copy and paste between applications and local machine, quickly upload or download files, and print to local or network printers. They can also listen to audio output from applications, and control the bandwidth and fidelity for the experience.

Customer stories
GE Renewable Energy harnesses the earth’s most abundant resources to power the world’s biggest economies and the most remote communities. Amazon AppStream 2.0 let GE’s IT team simplify their application management process by giving their global business units the ability to securely manage their own applications.
"With Amazon AppStream 2.0, we don’t operate any infrastructure, and scale on-demand to any number of users. And, we’re no longer the single team maintaining applications for each business unit. We simply configure a golden image, and let each team manage their application on it. This saves us days of work every month as we grow our deployment from hundreds to thousands of users.“
- Glorious Gaduang, Principal Cloud Architect, GE Renewable Energy
Samsung Engineering is a leading engineering, procurement, construction and project management company. Samsung Engineering needed to expand internationally, but their on-premises infrastructure made it difficult to deliver the graphics-intensive applications in the Hexagon engineering software suite to their employees and partners around the world.
“Our on-premises infrastructure was not set up to collaborate with our international partners, and expanding this infrastructure to meet our needs was cost-prohibitive. With AppStream 2.0, we've been able to build a global collaboration model while also reducing our operating costs by 30%. Delivering these solutions with the scalability and flexibility of AppStream 2.0 are a clear benefit that allow us to operate globally."
- Jeonghoon Lee, Senior Cloud Architect, Samsung Engineering Co
