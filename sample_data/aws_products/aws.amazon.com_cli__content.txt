AWS Command Line Interface
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), and various interactive features.

Usage
The AWS Command Line Interface User Guide walks you through installing and configuring the tool. After that, you can begin making calls to your AWS services from the command line.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances
$ aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1348636c
$ aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:546419318123:OperationsError --message "Script Failure"
$ aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://queue.amazonaws.com/546419318123/Test
You can get help on the command line to see the supported services,
$ aws help
the operations for a service,
$ aws autoscaling help
and the parameters for a service operation.
$ aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group help
File Commands for Amazon S3
New file commands make it easy to manage your Amazon S3 objects. Using familiar syntax, you can view the contents of your S3 buckets in a directory-based listing.
$ aws s3 ls s3://mybucket
LastWriteTime            Length Name
------------             ------ ----
PRE myfolder/
2013-09-03 10:00:00           1234 myfile.txt
You can perform recursive uploads and downloads of multiple files in a single folder-level command. The AWS CLI will run these transfers in parallel for increased performance.
$ aws s3 cp myfolder s3://mybucket/myfolder --recursive
upload: myfolder/file1.txt to s3://mybucket/myfolder/file1.txt
upload: myfolder/subfolder/file1.txt to s3://mybucket/myfolder/subfolder/file1.txt
A sync command makes it easy to synchronize the contents of a local folder with a copy in an S3 bucket.
$ aws s3 sync myfolder s3://mybucket/myfolder --exclude *.tmp
upload: myfolder/newfile.txt to s3://mybucket/myfolder/newfile.txt
