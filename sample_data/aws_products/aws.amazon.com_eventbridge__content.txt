Amazon EventBridge
Build event-driven applications at scale across AWS, existing systems, or SaaS apps
Get Started with Amazon EventBridge
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk or Shopify to targets like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real-time to your data sources with event publisher and consumer completely decoupled.

Benefits
Build event-driven architectures
EventBridge simplifies the process of building
event-driven architectures. With EventBridge, your event targets don’t need to be aware of event sources because you can filter and publish directly to EventBridge. There is no setup required. Improve developer agility as well as application resiliency with loosely coupled event-driven architectures.
Connect SaaS apps
EventBridge ingests data from supported SaaS applications and routes it to AWS services and SaaS targets (through API destinations - an HTTP invocation endpoint target for events) without writing custom integration code. You can use EventBridge to connect your SaaS apps, or use events from your SaaS apps to trigger workflows for customer support, business operations, and more.

Write less custom code
EventBridge makes it easier to connect applications. You can ingest, filter, transform and deliver events without writing custom code. The EventBridge schema registry stores a collection of easy-to-find event schemas and enables you to download code bindings for those schemas in your IDE so you can represent events as a strongly-typed objects in your code. Automatically add schemas discovered from your event bus to the registry through the schema discovery feature.
Reduce operational overhead
With EventBridge, there are no servers to provision, patch, and manage. There is no additional software to install, maintain, or operate. EventBridge automatically scales based on the number of events ingested, and you pay only for events published by your AWS or SaaS applications. EventBridge has built-in distributed availability and fault-tolerance. EventBridge also has a native event archive and replay capability that makes it easier to recover from failures or build a new application state from old events.
How it works
EventBridge connects applications using events. An event is a signal that a system’s state has changed, such as a change in the status of a customer support ticket. Customers can integrate their own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications, and custom applications as event sources which publish events to an event bus. You can define a filtering rule to filter events and route events to AWS service targets and API destinations (via HTTP endpoints). EventBridge schema registry stores schema generated by your organization’s applications, AWS services, or SaaS applications. A schema includes information such as the title, format and validation rules for event data. You can download code bindings for any schema in the registry in your IDE and directly use the strongly-typed object representing the event in your code.
Use cases
Re-architect for speed
Use EventBridge to accelerate modernizing and re-orchestrating your architecture with decoupled services and applications. With EventBridge, there is no need for heavy coordination between event producer and consumer applications or services. You can speed up your organization’s development process by allowing teams to iterate on features without explicit dependencies between systems.
Monitoring and Auditing
You can monitor and audit your AWS environments and respond to operational changes in your applications in real-time to prevent infrastructure vulnerabilities. For example, when your resources are accessed by cross-accounts or public accounts, you can configure an Amazon Access Analyzer event to be generated and sent to an AWS Lambda Function using EventBridge to remove the unintended permissions.
Extend functionality via SaaS integrations
You can extend the functionality of your applications by easily connecting them to other SaaS applications via EventBridge. For example, you can send custom events to EventBridge when a new user has been created in a free tier and send that event via API Destinations to Zendesk CRM.
Customize SaaS with AI/ML
You can enrich your events from SaaS applications using AWS Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning services and gain valuable insights. For example, you can load your data from Shopify to EventBridge to trigger a workflow and use AI services such as Amazon Comprehend for image tagging of new retail products.
