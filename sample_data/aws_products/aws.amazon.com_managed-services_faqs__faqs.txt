What types of operations plans does AWS Managed Services offer?
AWS Managed Services offers two operations plans to meet your needs: 1) AWS Managed Services Accelerate for your new and existing AWS accounts via detective controls, giving you full control and flexibility to use AWS as you always have, and 2) AWS Managed Services Advanced with preventative controls via a change management system within an AWS managed landing zone, which provides a full operational solution and trades some flexibility for increased operational rigor to protect your critical business applications. Customers can select either operations plan on an account by account basis.

Integrations can be performed by AWS Professional Services or an AWS Managed Services Partner.

Does AWS Managed Services manage applications?
AWS Managed Services (AMS) specializes in managing AWS infrastructure and services. AMS does not operate or configure your applications, however, we can work with application teams to develop application specific health monitoring through standard AWS services such as Amazon CloudWatch. By leveraging AMS, you can keep your AWS resources focused on innovation instead of undifferentiated operational tasks. For custom and packaged applications, we have a community of
AWS Partners who provide application management as part of their portfolio of services.
Does AWS Managed Services manage third party tools?
AWS Managed Services (AMS) manages certain third party tools as part of the AWS Managed Services Advanced operating plan including certain endpoint security, directory services, and network firewall tools. If you have an operational need specific to your tools or environment, we encourage you to contact your sales representative about Operations on Demand, currently available in the United States, to determine if we can provide custom operational capabilities.
When can I start working with AWS Managed Services?
AWS Managed Services (AMS) meets you where you are in your cloud journey. Whether you are considering a move to the cloud, in the process of migrating, or have workloads running on AWS, AMS can expand your operations capabilities. AWS Managed Services Accelerate works with your existing AWS accounts and workloads and can begin helping you operate quickly. AWS Managed Services Advanced can also begin helping you right away with our designated Cloud Service Delivery Manager and Cloud Architect resources who will help guide you through your operational planning and decisions making, and operations will begin once we have deployed our managed landing zone and the first workload has been migrated.
How do I interact with my AWS resources with AWS Managed Services?
AWS Managed Services (AMS) offers flexibility in how you interact with AWS resources. AWS Managed Services Accelerate customers can interact with AWS services as they do today, and leverage AWS APIs, AWS Console, AWS Command Line Interface, through the AMS Console, or any existing ISV integrations. AWS Managed Services Advanced customers will interact primarily through the AMS change management platform using AWS CloudFormation Templates and our automated requests for change. However, customers can also leverage Developer Mode to interact with services directly in their Dev Test accounts, and can self-provision services for select AWS services that benefit from direct interaction via the AWS Console or APIs.
