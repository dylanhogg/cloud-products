You can add, change or remove users for your CodeStar project through the “Team” section of the CodeStar console. You can choose to grant the users Owner, Contributor or Viewer permissions. You can also remove users or change their roles at any time.
Q: How do AWS CodeStar users relate to IAM users?
CodeStar users are IAM users that are managed by CodeStar to provide pre-built, role-based access policies across your development environment; Because CodeStar users are built on IAM, you still get the administrative benefits of IAM. For example, if you add an existing IAM user to a CodeStar project, the existing global account policies in IAM are still enforced.
Q: Can I work on my AWS CodeStar projects directly from an IDE?
Yes. By installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse or Visual Studio you gain the ability to easily configure your local development environment to work with CodeStar Projects; Once installed, developers can then select from a list of available CodeStar projects and have their development tooling automatically configured to clone and checkout their project’s source code, all from within their IDE.
Q: How do I configure my project dashboard?
Project dashboards can be configured to show the tiles you want, where you want them; To add or remove tiles, click on the “Tiles” drop‐down on your project dashboard. To change the layout of your project dashboard, drag the tile to your desired position.
Q: Are there third party integrations that I can use with AWS CodeStar?
