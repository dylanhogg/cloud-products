Benefits
Centrally manage backups
Configure backup policies from a central backup console, simplifying backup management and making it easy to ensure that your application data across AWS services is backed up and protected. Use AWS Backup’s central console, APIs, or command line interface to back up, restore, and set backup retention policies across AWS services.
Automate backup processes
Save time and money with AWS Backup’s fully managed, policy-based solution. AWS Backup provides automated backup schedules, retention management, and lifecycle management, removing the need for custom scripts and manual processes. With AWS Backup, you can apply backup policies to your AWS resources by simply tagging them, making it easy to implement your backup strategy across all your AWS resources and ensuring that all your application data is appropriately backed up.
Improve backup compliance
Enforce your backup policies, encrypt your backups, and audit and report on backup activity from a centralized console to help meet your backup compliance requirements. Backup policies make it simple to align your backup strategy with your internal or regulatory requirements. AWS Backup secures your backups by encrypting your data in transit and at rest. Consolidated backup activity logs across AWS services makes it easier to perform compliance audits. AWS Backup is PCI and ISO compliant as well as HIPAA eligible.
How it works
Use cases
Cloud-native backup
AWS Backup provides a centralized console to automate and manage backups across AWS services. AWS Backup supports Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx, Amazon EC2, and AWS Storage Gateway, to enable you to backup key data stores, such as your storage volumes, databases, and file systems.
Hybrid backup
AWS Backup integrates with AWS Storage Gateway, a hybrid storage service that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use AWS Cloud storage. You can use AWS Backup to back up your application data stored in AWS Storage Gateway volumes. Backups of AWS Storage Gateway volumes are securely stored in the AWS Cloud and are compatible with Amazon EBS, allowing you to restore your volumes to the AWS Cloud or to your on-premises environment. This integration also allows you to apply the same backup policies to both your AWS Cloud resources and your on-premises data stored on AWS Storage Gateway volumes.
