Get started with Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendar service with support for existing desktop and mobile email client applications. Amazon WorkMail gives users the ability to seamlessly access their email, contacts, and calendars using the client application of their choice, including Microsoft Outlook, native iOS and Android email applications, any client application supporting the IMAP protocol, or directly through a web browser. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate directory, use email journaling to meet compliance requirements, and control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.

Benefits
Managed service
Amazon WorkMail makes it easy to manage your corporate email infrastructure and eliminates the need for up-front investments to license and provision on-premises email servers. There is no complex software to install or maintain and no hardware to manage. Amazon WorkMail automatically handles all of the patches, back-ups, and upgrades.
Enterprise-grade security
Amazon WorkMail automatically encrypts all of your data at rest with encryption keys you control, using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Amazon WorkMail also allows you to retain full control over data locality by choosing the AWS region where all of your data is stored.
Outlook compatible
Amazon WorkMail provides native support for Microsoft Outlook on both Windows and Mac OS X, so users can continue to use the email client they are already using without needing to install any additional software, such as plug-ins for Microsoft Outlook.
Anywhere access
Users can synchronize their mailboxes with iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, and Windows Phone devices. If you are migrating from an on-premises Microsoft Exchange server, your usersâ€™ mobile devices can automatically connect to Amazon WorkMail with no end-user reconfiguration required, and no change in user experience. A feature-rich web client is also available for users to access their email, calendar, and contacts.
Active directory integration
Amazon WorkMail securely integrates with your existing Microsoft Active Directory so that users can access their mailbox using their existing credentials. This also makes it easy to manage users and groups with familiar systems management tools, such as Active Directory Users and Computers.
Low cost
Amazon WorkMail features simple, low, monthly per-user pricing and costs $4 per user per month which includes 50GB of storage per user.
