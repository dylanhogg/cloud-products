In pole position to learn reinforcement learning
AWS DeepRacer gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique that takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

The rubber meets the road
AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test RL models by racing on a physical track. Using cameras to view the track and a reinforcement model to control throttle and steering, the car shows how a model trained in a simulated environment can be transferred to the real-world.

Introducing the AWS DeepRacer Evo
AWS DeepRacer Evo is the next generation in autonomous racing. It comes fully equipped with stereo cameras and LiDAR sensor to enable object avoidance and head-to-head racing, giving developers everything they need to take their racing to the next level. In object avoidance races, developers use the sensors to detect and avoid obstacles placed on the track. In head-to-head, developers race against another DeepRacer on the same track and try to avoid it while still turning in the best lap time. Forward facing left and right cameras make up the stereo cameras, which helps the car learn depth information in images. This information can then be used to sense and avoid objects being approached on the track. The LiDAR sensor is backward facing and detects objects behind and beside the car.
