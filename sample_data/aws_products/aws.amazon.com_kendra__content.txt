What is Amazon Kendra? (1:26)
Get better answers upfront using natural language
Use natural language questions in addition to just simple keywords to get the answers you’re looking for. Kendra will return an exact answer from within a document, whether that is a text snippet, FAQ, or PDF document. Instead of sifting through long lists of documents to find specific answers, Kendra also provides suggested answers upfront. See the difference between the search experience before and after Kendra.
