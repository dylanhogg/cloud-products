Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
Highly available, secure, and managed monitoring for your containers
Get started with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (Preview)
Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications at scale. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Prometheus project is a popular open source monitoring and alerting solution optimized for container environments. With AMP, you can use the open source Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor the performance of containerized workloads, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. AMP automatically scales the ingestion, storage, and querying of operational metrics as workloads grow or shrink, and is integrated with AWS security services to enable fast and secure access to data. The service is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
Benefits
The Prometheus you already know
Use the familiar, flexible Prometheus query language (PromQL) to filter, aggregate, and alarm on metrics, and quickly gain performance visibility for large volumes of metrics labels. AMP supports all metric types: gauge, counter, summary, and histogram.
Prometheus at scale. Easily
AMP automatically scales as your ingestion and query needs grow, handling millions of unique time series metrics from large container deployments while maintaining consistent query response times. AMP offers multi-AZ replication within an AWS Region.
Prometheus with intrinsic security
AMP integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management for authentication and fine-grained permissions for users and groups. AWS PrivateLink provides easy and secure access to services hosted on AWS, keeping your network traffic within the AWS network. AWS Organizations integration allows for policy control, and API calls are logged to AWS CloudTrail.
Monitor containers on AWS and on-premises
You can quickly set up AMP to collect and query metrics from AWS container services including Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS. AMP also includes an API that makes it easy to securely ingest and query metrics from all your self-managed Kubernetes clusters, on AWS or on-premises.
Reduce operational costs
AMP is a fully managed service, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting of running open source Prometheus at scale, so that you can focus on innovating. With AMP, you can also significantly reduce the operational costs of configuring, upgrading, and scaling standalone Prometheus servers.
Maximize impact with AWS observability services
Native integration lets you get the most out of AWS observability services. AMP uses AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry for service discovery and metric collection, and is integrated with Amazon Managed Service for Grafana for rich, powerful data visualizations. This complements other AWS observability services such as Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
How it works
Use cases
Unified container monitoring
Monitor containers running on Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS, as well as hybrid environments including on-premises. Use AMP together with Amazon Managed Service for Grafana for monitoring, alerts, and dashboard views across all your container environments, including both host- and application-level monitoring.
Troubleshooting and root cause analysis
Use the powerful PromQL language to detect errors and reduce mean time to resolution. Triggered alerts can be interrogated with PromQL to find systemic versus isolated health and performance issues across all of your short-lived containers.
Workload and application metrics monitoring
With AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, you can collect metrics from anywhere and enrich them with trace IDs. Prometheus’ library of open source exporters for many popular application stacks (including Apache Kafka, Redis, Java/JMX, NGINX, and even Minecraft servers) can be used to send those metrics to AMP.
High-cardinality metrics monitoring
AMP is well suited for monitoring on high-cardinality data such as video streams and network applications. You can also use it with time series data from IoT devices to slice and dice based on multiple labels such as location, category, and user.
