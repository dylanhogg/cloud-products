AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and guidance for AWS events that might affect your environment. While the Service Health Dashboard shows the general status of AWS services, the Personal Health Dashboard provides proactive and transparent notifications about your specific AWS environment.
All AWS customers can access the Personal Health Dashboard. The Personal Health Dashboard shows recent events to help you manage active events, and shows proactive notifications so that you can plan for scheduled activities. Use these alerts to get notified about changes that can affect your AWS resources, and then follow the guidance to diagnose and resolve issues.
Benefits
Personalized view of service health
The Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view of the status of AWS services that power your applications. Use the Personal Health Dashboard to learn about specific operational issues that affect your account. For example, if you receive an event for a lost Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume associated with one of your Amazon EC2 instances, you can use the event to quickly view the status of your impacted resources, and then troubleshoot and determine remediation steps.
Proactive notifications
Unlike the Service Health Dashboard, you can use the Personal Health Dashboard to create alerts for specific events that might affect your account. You can set up alerts across multiple channels, including email and mobile notifications, to receive timely and relevant information to help plan for scheduled changes. For example, if a maintenance event is scheduled for one of your Amazon EC2 instances, you can receive an alert with information to help you plan for, and proactively address any issues for the upcoming change.
Detailed troubleshooting guidance
When you get an alert, it includes remediation details and specific guidance so that you can take action for events that affect your resources. For example, if a hardware issue affects one of your Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, the alert includes a list of affected resources, and recommendations and help links to restore your volume from a snapshot. This helps you reduce the amount of time to resolve issues.
Integration and automation
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to build custom rules and select targets, such as AWS Lambda functions, to define automated remediation actions for specific events.
You can use the AWS Health API, the service that powers Personal Health Dashboard, to integrate health data and notifications with your existing in-house or third-party IT management tools. The AWS Health API is part of an AWS Business Support or AWS Enterprise Support plan.
Fine-grained access control by using IAM
The Personal Health Dashboard supports access control so that you can set up permissions based on event metadata. This allows you to grant or deny access to an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user based on attributes, such as event types, specific services, or other role-based attributes. You can restrict access of sensitive events, such as security events, to only the users that need to see them.
Aggregate health events across AWS Organizations
If you use AWS Organizations, you can use AWS Health to aggregate notifications from all accounts in your organization. This provides you a centralized and real-time view for all AWS Health events posted to individual accounts in your organization, including operational issues, scheduled maintenance, and account notifications.
