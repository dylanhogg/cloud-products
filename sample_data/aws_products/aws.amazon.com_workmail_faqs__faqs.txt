You can migrate your existing mailboxes to Amazon WorkMail using solutions from a preferred Amazon WorkMail migration provider. To see a list of providers, please visit this webpage. If you’re migrating from Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 or 2010, you can set up interoperability to minimize disruption for your end users.
Q: Does Amazon WorkMail support interoperability with Microsoft Exchange Server?
Yes, Amazon WorkMail supports interoperability with Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and 2010. You can learn about how to set up interoperability here.
Q: What interoperability capabilities does Amazon WorkMail support?
Interoperability allows you to use the same corporate domain for all mailboxes on both Microsoft Exchange and Amazon WorkMail. Your users can seamlessly schedule meetings with bi-directional sharing of calendar free-busy information between the two environments, and access user and resource information through a unified global address book.
Q: Which versions of Microsoft Exchange Server are supported with Amazon WorkMail interoperability?
Amazon WorkMail offers interoperability support with Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and 2010.
Q: Are there additional charges to use interoperability features?
No. Interoperability features are included in Amazon WorkMail per mailbox pricing.
Q: Can users access Amazon WorkMail using their existing Microsoft Active Directory credentials?
Yes, users can connect to Amazon WorkMail using their existing Microsoft Active Directory credentials.
Q: Will mailboxes on Amazon WorkMail use the same domain as mailboxes on my Microsoft Exchange server?

Q: Which email platform handles incoming email traffic when interoperability is established?
Your on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server handles and processes all incoming email. If you’re using interoperability for migration, you can switch your MX record to point to Amazon WorkMail when your migration is complete.
Q: Can I restrict access to my Microsoft Exchange Server to just my VPC?
No, you can’t restrict access to the Exchange Server to your VPC. As of now, the EWS endpoint of your on-premises Microsoft Exchange environment needs to be publicly available.
Q: Does Amazon WorkMail support bi-directional sharing of calendar free-busy information with Microsoft Exchange?
Yes, interoperability provides you bi-directional sharing of calendar free-busy information between your Amazon WorkMail and Microsoft Exchange environments. Please follow the steps here.
Q: How does Amazon WorkMail interact with my on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server to perform bi-directional calendar free-busy lookups?
You will need to configure availability settings on Amazon WorkMail and Microsoft Exchange to share calendar free-busy information. Amazon WorkMail uses the EWS URL for your Microsoft Exchange server to perform free-busy lookups. Amazon WorkMail uses an Exchange service account to login to Exchange and read free-busy data of the users in the Microsoft Exchange organization.
For free-busy lookups of Amazon WorkMail users from your Microsoft Exchange Server, Exchange performs an Autodiscover request and connects to the Amazon WorkMail EWS endpoint using an Amazon WorkMail service account. You can find more information on this here.
Q: Do I need to set up federation on my on-premises Microsoft Exchange server?
No, for interoperability support with Amazon WorkMail, you don’t need to set up federation on your Microsoft Exchange server.
Q: Can I also view subject and location in the free-busy details when interoperability is enabled?
Yes, to view subject and location information, the service account user needs to have access to this information.
Q: Can an Amazon WorkMail user manage the shared calendar or shared folder of a user on Microsoft Exchange (and vice versa).
No, for calendar delegation or accessing shared folders, both users need to be on the same email platform. We recommend migrating users who use calendar and mailbox delegation in the same batch.
Q: How does Amazon WorkMail interact with my on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server to create a unified global address book?
Once interoperability support is enabled, Amazon WorkMail performs a synchronization of the address book with your on-premises Active Directory every four hours, using AD Connector. All Microsoft Exchange users, groups, and resources are automatically added to your Amazon WorkMail address book.
Q: Will all Microsoft Exchange Server objects synchronize to the Amazon WorkMail global address book?
Amazon WorkMail will synchronize users, groups, resources, and contacts that reside in Microsoft Exchange Server. Amazon WorkMail will not synchronize dynamic groups or address lists. When your Microsoft Exchange global address book contains these objects, they won't be available in Amazon WorkMail.
Q: Will Amazon WorkMail still synchronize with my Active Directory when interoperability support isn’t enabled?
Yes, Amazon WorkMail will still synchronize with your Active Directory when interoperability support is disabled. In this scenario only changes to Amazon WorkMail users and groups are synchronized.
Q: Does the Microsoft Outlook offline address book also contain all my Microsoft Exchange users, and groups, and resources?
Yes, the Microsoft Outlook offline address book will contain both Amazon WorkMail Microsoft Exchange users, groups, and resources.
Q: Can my distribution groups contain both Amazon WorkMail and Microsoft Exchange users as members?
Yes, you can have both Amazon WorkMail and Microsoft Exchange users as members of distribution groups.
Q: Can I still create new resource in Amazon WorkMail when interoperability support is enabled?
No. To create new resources in Amazon WorkMail, you first need to disable interoperability support. Once your new resources have been created, you can then turn interoperability support back on. This is done to ensure resources are synchronized back to your Microsoft Exchange Server.
Email Flow Rules
Q: What are email flow rules?
Amazon WorkMail allows you to use email flow rules to filter or route email traffic for your Amazon WorkMail organizations. On inbound emails, this can help you reduce email from unwanted senders, route suspicious mail to junk folders, and trigger AWS Lambda functions. On outbound, you can block sending to certain domains, route mail through custom SMTP endpoints, or trigger Lambda functions. Email flow rules can be applied based on specific email addresses, or entire email domains.
Q: What types of email flow rules can I create?
For inbound mail, mail flow rules can be created to filter email based on specific email addresses, or entire email domains. Examples include:
Reject all incoming mail from example.com and its subdomains, generating a bounce message to the sender.
Reject all incoming mail from example.com, except when from myemail@example.com.
Reject all incoming mail from user@example.com.
Bypass the spam check for all incoming email from example.com, delivering the messages instead to users' inbox.
Deliver all messages from example.com to users' junk folders.
Trigger AWS Lambda function that you define on receiving mail.
For outbound mail, mail flow rules can be created to filter email or route to an SMTP endpoint or AWS Lambda function. Examples include:
Reject all outgoing mail from example.com to example2.com, generating an non-deliverable report (NDR) to the sender.
Reject all outgoing mail to example.com silently.
Route all mail from example.com that is going to a domain other than example.com through a custom SMTP endpoint that you define.
Trigger AWS Lambda function that you define on all outgoing mail.
Q:What types of email data are passed to the Lambda function?
The Lambda function will receive the message id, sender, recipient, and subject of an email.
Q: Can I retrieve more information about an email message from within my Lambda?
Yes, you can retrieve the full content of the email message using WorkMail’s SDKs.
See the Admin Guide for more information.
Q: What format does the email content come in when retrieving it from my Lambda?
The WorkMail SDK will return the raw MIME content of the message that is being processed. You can use common MIME-processing libraries, such as JavaMail for Java or email.parser for Python to convert this to a structured format for easier parsing.
Q: Can I stop or re-route an email using a Lambda function?
Yes, you can configure a Lambda action to run your Lambda synchronously and return response from your Lambda to control flow of an email to stop. See
synchronous Lambda action for more information about Configuring Synchronous Run Lambda Action.
Q: How can I start using email flow rules?
Rules can be set up from the Amazon WorkMail management console by navigating to Organization Settings. You can create, modify, and delete flow rules under the Email Flow Rules tab.
Q: Can I perform filtering based on IP address or range?
IP based filtering is already supported by Amazon Simple Email Service. Please see Creating IP Address Filters for Amazon SES Email Receiving to learn more about IP-based filtering.
Q: What happens if email containing a virus is received from a source specified to bypass spam checks?
Amazon WorkMail scans all incoming and outgoing email for spam, malware, and viruses. All email containing viruses is dropped and not delivered, regardless of the configured flow rules.
Q: What happens if email flow rules overlap?
If you have email for which multiple email flow rules match, the action of the most specific rule will be applied. For example, a rule for a specific email address will take precedence over a rule for an entire domain. If multiple rules have the same specificity, the most restrictive action will be applied (for example, Drop will take precedence over Bounce). Please see Managing Email Flows for more information.
Q: How can I test email flow rules before applying it on real emails?
You can create a rule with a single email address as Sender domains or addresses condition, and choose the action you want to use. You can then send test emails to or from the single address you chose to confirm that the rule is behaving as you expect. Once satisfied with the result, you can extend the rule for other Sender domains or addresses.
When using Lambda rules, you can also test your Lambda with a dummy request event in AWS Lambda console. See Lambda event data for an example of event data. See invoke the Lambda fuction for more information about invoking Lambda from Lambda console.
Q: Are there limits on the number of rules I can create?
Yes. To learn more about limits related to email flow rules, please see AWS Service Limits.
Q: How long does a rule need to take effect?
Rules take effect immediately after creation.
Q: Is there any additional charge for defining email flow rules?
No, there is no additional charge for using email flow rules.
