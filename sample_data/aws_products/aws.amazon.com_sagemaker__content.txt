Amazon SageMaker
Machine learning for every data scientist and developer
Get Started with SageMaker
Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning (ML) models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML.
The most comprehensive ML service
Accelerate innovation with purpose-built tools for every step of ML development, including labeling, data preparation, feature engineering, statistical bias detection, auto-ML, training, tuning, hosting, explainability, monitoring, and workflows.
The first integrated development environment (IDE) for ML
Boost your productivity using Amazon SageMaker Studio, the first fully integrated development environment designed specifically for ML that brings everything you need for ML under one unified, visual user interface.
Functionality designed from the ground up to work together
Use Amazon SageMaker’s integrated capabilities for ML development, so you can eliminate months of writing custom integration code, and ultimately reduce cost.

Build, train, and tune models automatically
Amazon SageMaker Autopilot selects the best algorithm for the prediction, and automatically builds, trains, and tunes machine learning models without any loss of visibility or control.
Reduce data labeling costs by up to 70%
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth makes it easy to more accurately label training datasets for a variety of use cases including 3D point clouds, video, images, and text.
The fastest and easiest way to prepare data for ML
Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces the time it takes to prepare data for ML from weeks to minutes. With a few clicks, you can complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization.
Purpose-built feature store for ML
Amazon SageMaker Feature Store provides a repository to store, update, retrieve, and share ML features. SageMaker Feature Store offers one consistent view of features for ML models to use so it becomes significantly easier to generate models that produce highly accurate predictions.
Train high-quality models faster
Amazon SageMaker provides a built-in debugger and a profiler so you can identify and reduce training errors and performance bottlenecks from your models before pushing them to production.
One-click deployment to the cloud
Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to deploy your trained model to production with a single click, so you can start generating predictions for real-time or batch data.
Improve quality of models on edge devices
Amazon SageMaker Edge Manager helps you optimize, secure, monitor, and maintain machine learning models on fleets of edge devices to ensure that models deployed on edge devices are operating correctly.
Essential features for ML in production
Automate machine learning workflows
Amazon SageMaker Pipelines is the first purpose-built, easy-to-use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for machine learning. Workflows can be shared and re-used between teams.
Detect bias and understand predictions
Amazon SageMaker Clarify provides bias detection across the ML workflow, enabling you to build greater fairness and transparency into your ML model. SageMaker Clarify also includes feature importance graphs that help you explain model predictions and produces reports which can be used to support internal presentations or to identify issues with your model that you can take steps to correct.
Secure your data and code throughout the ML lifecycle
Amazon SageMaker offers a comprehensive set of security features, including encryption, private network connectivity, authorization, authentication, monitoring, and auditability to help your organization with security requirements that may apply to machine learning workloads.
Improve transparency
