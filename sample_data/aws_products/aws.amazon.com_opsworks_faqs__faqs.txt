Q: What is AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate?
AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate provides a fully managed Chef server and suite of automation tools that give you workflow automation for continuous deployment, automated testing for compliance and security, and a user interface that gives you visibility into your nodes and their status. The Chef server gives you full stack automation by handling operational tasks such as software and operating system configurations, package installations, database setups, and more. The Chef server centrally stores your configuration tasks and provides them to each node in your compute environment at any scale, from a few nodes to thousands of nodes. OpsWorks for Chef Automate is completely compatible with tooling and cookbooks from the Chef community and automatically registers new nodes with your Chef server.

You can transform your company into a highly collaborative, software-driven organization with Chef Automate as the engine. To learn more, see the Chef Automate product details page.
Q: How do I use the Chef Automate console?
Chef Automate includes its own console. The Chef Automate Console can be accessed through the OpsWorks link on the the AWS Management Console. After you click the link, you will be prompted for the credentials that you were assigned when you set up the Chef Automate server.
Q: I am an AWS OpsWorks Stacks customer. Should I migrate to OpsWorks for Chef Automate?
OpsWorks Stacks customers who are looking for full Chef server compatibility are encouraged to use OpsWorks for Chef Automate. To learn more about OpsWorks Stacks, see the OpsWorks Stacks product details page.
Q: How can I migrate from OpsWorks Stacks to OpsWorks for Chef Automate?
Before you migrate, you first have to adapt your OpsWorks cookbooks to work on a Chef server. Some may work without alterations, however. If you are using OpsWorks instance scaling (either time-based or load-based), you’ll need to use an EC2 Auto Scaling group and OpsWork Chef’s node registration feature instead. You will later be able to work with your Chef server and nodes by using Chef’s Visibility console or Knife.
Q: Which versions of Chef are supported?
The OpsWorks for Chef Automate service will regularly upgrade your Chef server to the latest recommended version. Please see our documentation for the latest supported version. We recommend running the most current, stable chef-client version on nodes associated with an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server.
Q: Which cloud resources power my AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server?
AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate uses proven AWS features and services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, and Amazon CloudWatch to create the components that make up your managed Chef server. OpsWorks for Chef Automate uses the Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Q: How can I back up my Chef server?
You can define a daily or weekly recurring Chef server backup. The service stores the backups in Amazon S3 on your behalf. Alternatively, you can choose to create manual backups on demand.
Q: How many backups can I keep for every Chef server?
Backups are stored in Amazon S3 and incur additional fees. You can define a backup retention period of up to 30 generations. You can submit a service request to change that limit by using AWS Support channels.
Q: How can I restore my Chef server to an earlier point in time?
After browsing through your available backups, you can choose a point in time from which to restore your Chef server. Server backups contain only Chef software persistent data such as cookbooks and registered nodes.
Q: Which resources can I connect to my Chef server?
You can connect any EC2 instance or on-premises server that is running a supported operating system and has Internet access to an OpsWorks for Chef Automate server. You are charged an hourly fee for every connected resource.
Q: How do I register nodes with the Chef server?
You’ll get user-data code snippets through the console. You can put these code snippets in an EC2 Auto Scaling group. These code snippets ensure that your instances are registered to your Chef server as Chef nodes, and that they run the corresponding Chef recipes. On-premises servers require that you install the Chef client agent software and register the server with your Chef server.
Q: How can I obtain Chef related training?
You can choose your preferred Chef Automate training method from Chef’s website.

Maintenance window
Q: How can I keep the underlying Chef server running and up-to-date?
Your managed configuration management server is updated to the latest version of Chef Automate during the maintenance window that you configure. OpsWorks for Chef Automate also regularly runs security updates and operating system package updates for you.
Q: What is an OpsWorks for Chef Automate maintenance window?
A maintenance window is a daily or weekly one-hour time slot during which OpsWorks for Chef Automate initiates Chef version updates without breaking changes, security updates, and operating system package updates. For example, if you select a maintenance window that begins every Sunday at 2:00 A.M., OpsWorks for Chef Automate initiates the platform update between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M. every Sunday.
The maintenance window is set on a per-Chef-server basis, so you can set different maintenance times for different Chef servers. If you want to change when maintenance is performed, you can use the OpsWorks for Chef Automate console, the AWS CLI or APIs.
Q: How do I set up a maintenance window?
The maintenance window is enabled by default and can be set during the Chef server setup phase. You can change settings later by using the AWS Management Console, CLI, or APIs.
Q: What kinds of version updates will be performed by OpsWorks for Chef Automate?
OpsWorks for Chef Automate performs version updates automatically as long as the updates include backward-compatible changes. When new versions of Chef software become available, system maintenance is designed to update the version of Chef Automate and Chef Server on the server automatically, as soon as the version update passes AWS testing. AWS performs extensive testing to verify that Chef upgrades are production-ready and do not disrupt existing customer environments, so there can be lags between Chef software releases and their availability for application to existing OpsWorks for Chef Automate servers.
Q: When and how can I perform major version updates?
You can perform major version updates at any time by using the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate console, API, or CLI.
Q: How does AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate apply updates?
The updates are applied directly to the managed EC2 instance on which the Chef server is running. If the OpsWorks for Chef Automate health system detects any issues during the update, OpsWorks for Chef Automate will roll back changes and try again during the next maintenance window.
Q: Will my Chef server be available during the maintenance window?
Your Chef server is not available when maintenance updates are being applied. Your connected nodes enter a pending-server state until maintenance is complete. The connected nodes will continue to operate normally.
Q: How will I be notified of the availability of new OpsWorks for Chef Automate versions?
You are notified about new Chef versions through the OpsWorks for Chef Automate console. The service console informs you if your Chef server was updated during the maintenance window.
Q: Where can I find details about changes between platform versions?
Details about changes between Chef Automate versions are on the Chef Automate Release Notes page.
Q: How often are platform version updates released?
The number of version releases each year varies based on the frequency of Chef Automate patch releases from Chef and acceptance testing performed by AWS.
