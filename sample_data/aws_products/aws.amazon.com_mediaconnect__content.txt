AWS Elemental MediaConnect is a high-quality transport service for live video. Today, broadcasters and content owners rely on satellite networks or fiber connections to send their high-value content into the cloud or to transmit it to partners for distribution. Both satellite and fiber approaches are expensive, require long lead times to set up, and lack the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. To be more nimble, some customers have tried to use solutions that transmit live video on top of IP infrastructure, but have struggled with reliability and security.
Now you can get the reliability and security of satellite and fiber combined with the flexibility, agility, and economics of IP-based networks using AWS Elemental MediaConnect. MediaConnect enables you to build mission-critical live video workflows in a fraction of the time and cost of satellite or fiber services. You can use MediaConnect to ingest live video from a remote event site (like a stadium), share video with a partner (like a cable TV distributor), or replicate a video stream for processing (like an over-the-top service). MediaConnect combines reliable video transport, highly secure stream sharing, and real-time network traffic and video monitoring that allow you to focus on your content, not your transport infrastructure.
