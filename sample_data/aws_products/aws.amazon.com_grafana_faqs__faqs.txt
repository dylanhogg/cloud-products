Q: What is Grafana?
Grafana is an open source data visualization and operational dashboarding solution used by hundreds of thousands of organizations and millions of users. Grafana’s rich visualization library and broad support for multiple data sources makes it simple for customers to query, visualize, and alert on a wide variety of operational data, including metrics, logs, and traces in a single console. Amazon Managed Service for Grafana provides fully managed Grafana workspaces compatible with the open source project and developed in partnership with Grafana Labs, parent company of the open source project.
Q: What is an Amazon Managed Service for Grafana Workspace?
A workspace is a logically isolated Grafana server. Once you have created a workspace, you can integrate it with data sources and then query and visualize metrics from these data sources. You can create multiple workspaces per Region, per account, so that you can create isolated Grafana workspaces for monitoring your Prod and Dev workloads separately.
Q: How do I enable multi-account, multi-Region access to my AWS data sources?
Amazon Managed Service for Grafana integrates with AWS Organizations to discover the AWS accounts and resources in your Organizational Units. Using AWS CloudFormation StackSets, Amazon Managed Service for Grafana will automatically create the IAM policies needed to grant read-only access to your AWS Services data for the accounts and Regions you choose. Using the Amazon Managed Service for Grafana console, you can easily add or remove accounts, Organizational Units, and Regions that you want to add to each Grafana workspace.
Q: How do I upgrade to Grafana Enterprise?
In the Amazon Managed Service for Grafana console, you can select the workspace you’d like to upgrade to Grafana Enterprise. You can optionally upgrade one or more workspaces; each upgraded workspace will have access to Enterprise plugins. This enables you to query and visualize data from AppDynamics, Datadog, Dynatrace, MongoDB, New Relic, Oracle Database, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Splunk, and Wavefront.
Q: Is there CloudFormation support for creating Amazon Managed Service for Grafana Workspaces?
Not currently in preview.
Q: What are the types of Grafana users?
There are three user types in Grafana: Administrators, Editors, and Viewers. Administrators have add, edit, and delete permissions to manage data sources, users, teams, folders, and dashboards. Editors have view, add, edit, and delete permissions to dashboards and alerts. Viewers can view dashboards to which they have been granted access, but cannot add, edit, or delete data sources, dashboards, or alerts.
Q: Which Grafana data source plugins are supported?
Amazon Managed Service for Grafana provides native integration for multiple AWS Services, including Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, AWS IoT SiteWise, Amazon Timestream, and AWS X-Ray.

Directly from the Amazon Managed Service for Grafana console, you can optionally upgrade to paid third-party, enterprise plugins made available with a Grafana Enterprise license purchase, which enables access to AppDynamics, Datadog, Dynatrace, MongoDB, New Relic, Oracle Database, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Splunk, and Wavefront. Reference the Amazon Managed Service for Grafana User Guide for the full list of supported data source plugins.
Q: What are teams in Amazon Managed Service for Grafana and why should I use them?
Teams provide a grouping mechanism to organize users in Amazon Managed Service for Grafana. You can use teams to group individual users into entities that are granted access to shared resources such as dashboards, data sources, and alerts. Teams can also be mapped to your LDAP groups. With Team Sync enabled, you can keep team membership and user identities in sync with enterprise directories such as Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Active Directory, and OKTA Cloud Directory.
Pricing
Q: How is Amazon Managed Service for Grafana priced?
You are billed monthly for the total number of active users that have logged in to each Grafana workspace. There are two tiers of users: an Editor user price that can be assigned Administrator or Editor roles, and a Viewer user price that can be assigned a Viewer role. For detailed pricing information, please reference the Amazon Managed Service for Grafana pricing page.
Q: What is an active user?
An “Active user” has logged in to an Amazon Managed Service for Grafana workspace at least once during a monthly billing cycle. Users who are provisioned with access to Grafana workspaces but have not used the service at least once in the monthly billing cycle will not be charged.
Q: Can I create multiple workspaces?
Yes, you can create multiple workspaces. Users are billed per workspace per month. For example, if User A belongs to both Workspace 1 and Workspace 2, User A will be billed for using Workspace 1 and separately billed for using Workspace 2.
Q: Will I be charged for API requests?
There are no additional fees for using Amazon Managed Service for Grafana's APIs. However, Amazon Managed Service for Grafana queries data from other AWS Services and third-party ISVs that may charge fees for using their APIs. For example, a dashboard in Amazon Managed Service for Grafana that contains CloudWatch metrics will make Get requests to Amazon CloudWatch, and this will incur API fees on your CloudWatch bill.
Q: How do I upgrade my Amazon Managed Service for Grafana workspace to Grafana Enterprise?
You can optionally upgrade to Grafana Enterprise directly from the AWS Console, enabling you to access Enterprise plugins that connect to a wide variety of third-party ISVs, as well as access support and training directly from Grafana Labs. By upgrading to Grafana Enterprise, you can continue to use your existing Amazon Managed Service for Grafana workspaces, and receive additional features in the upgraded workspace, all fully managed on Amazon Managed Service for Grafana. If you decide to unsubscribe Grafana Enterprise from a workspace, this will disable Grafana Enterprise features for that workspace; however, you can continue to use the workspace and access Amazon Managed Service for Grafana features.
Q: How will I be billed if I have both Amazon Managed Service for Grafana and Grafana Enterprise?
You will receive one bill with your Amazon Managed Service for Grafana usage, based on active Editor and active Viewer users per workspace per month. If you upgrade your Amazon Managed Service for Grafana workspace(s) to Grafana Enterprise, you will see charges for Grafana Enterprise on your AWS Marketplace bill. Grafana Enterprise pricing is in addition to Amazon Managed Service for Grafana's per Editor and per Viewer pricing.
