General
Who are the primary users of AWS Data Exchange?
AWS Data Exchange makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange and use third-party data in AWS. Data analysts, product managers, portfolio managers, data scientists, quants, clinical trial technicians, and developers in nearly every industry would like access to more data to drive analytics, train machine-learning models, and make data-driven decisions. But there is no one place to find data from multiple providers and no consistency in how providers deliver data, leaving them to deal with a mix of shipped physical media, FTP credentials, and bespoke API calls. Conversely, many organizations would like to make their data available for either research or commercial purposes, but it’s too hard and expensive to build and maintain data delivery, entitlement, and billing technology, which further depresses the supply of valuable data.
What AWS regions is AWS Data Exchange available in?
AWS Data Exchange has a single, globally available product catalog offered by providers. You can see the same catalog regardless of which region you are using. The resources underlying the product (data sets, revisions, assets) are regional resources that you manage programmatically or through the AWS Data Exchange console in specific AWS Regions. See the AWS Regional Availability Table for a list of AWS Regions in which AWS Data Exchange is available today.
What is the difference between AWS Data Exchange and the Registry of Open Data on AWS?
There are five key differences between AWS Data Exchange and the Registry of Open Data on AWS. First, AWS Data Exchange supports both free and commercial data products, with any applicable commercial fees applied to a customer’s AWS invoice, whereas the Registry of Open Data on AWS gives customers access to a curated list of free and open data sets. Secondly, AWS Data Exchange requires customers to explicitly agree to the Data Subscription Agreement outlining the terms that the data provider set when publishing their product, whereas the data on the Registry of Open Data on AWS does not have terms of use. Thirdly, customers must use the AWS Data Exchange API to copy data from AWS Data Exchange to their desired S3 location, whereas the Registry of Open Data on AWS data sets are accessed via S3 APIs. Fourthly, AWS Data Exchange delivers data providers access to daily, weekly and monthly reports detailing subscription activity, whereas with Registry of Open Data on AWS, data providers must analyze their own logs to track usage of data. Finally, to become a data provider on AWS Data Exchange, qualified customers must register as a data provider on AWS Marketplace to be eligible to list both free and commercial products, whereas any customer can add free data to Registry of Open Data on AWS via GitHub and may apply to the AWS Public Dataset Program for AWS to sponsor the costs of storage and bandwidth for select open data sets.
Subscriber
What type of data can I subscribe to in AWS Data Exchange?
Today, AWS Data Exchange contains more than 1,000 data products from a broad range of domains, including financial services (e.g. top US businesses by revenue), healthcare and life sciences (e.g. population health management), geospatial (e.g. satellite imagery), weather (e.g. historical and future trajectories of temperature), and mapping (e.g. street level imagery and foot traffic patterns). For a complete list of data providers, see the AWS Data Exchange catalog. If customers need additional data sources not currently available on AWS Data Exchange they can log these requests here.
How can I see the catalog of AWS Data Exchange products?
Anyone can browse the AWS Data Exchange catalog in AWS Marketplace under the “Data” category, or by searching AWS Marketplace for keywords of interest. Authenticated AWS customers can also browse the AWS Data Exchange catalog alongside existing subscriptions in the AWS Data Exchange console. For more details, see Getting Started as a Subscriber.
How will I know when new revisions to data sets I’m subscribed to become available?
As a subscriber with an active subscription to a product, you will receive a CloudWatch event from AWS Data Exchange everytime new revision(s) are published by the provider. You can use this CloudWatch Event to automate consumption of new data. To learn more, see Logging and monitoring on AWS Data Exchange.
Can I migrate pre-existing data subscriptions to be delivered by AWS Data Exchange?
Yes. AWS Data Exchange allows qualified data providers to fulfill to existing subscribers using a “Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS)” entitlement at no additional cost. Using BYOS, the existing billing relationship will continue between you and the data provider. Talk to your data provider to leverage this capability.
What are the subscription durations that are available for AWS Data Exchange products?
Data providers list products subscriptions that range from 1 to 36 months. Subscription duration options can be found on each product’s detail page.
Can I set my subscription to auto-renew?
Providers have the option to enable auto-renewal on individual offers. As a subscriber, you can choose to set your subscription to auto-renew on the offers that have the auto-renewal functionality enabled. Auto-renewal is available for public and private offers.
Can data providers change the terms of the offer that I am subscribed to? How would it affect my subscription and renewal?
Yes. Data providers can update the terms of the offer at any time but doing so will not affect existing subscriptions. For subscriptions set to auto-renew, AWS Data Exchange will automatically renew the subscription at the latest terms that the provider specified on or by renewal date, which may be different from the original subscription terms. For more information, see Product Subscriptions.
How are refunds handled?  AWS Data Exchange requires data providers to specify their refund policy, which you can see on the subscription details page. For any refund requests, you will need to contact the provider directly. Once a provider approves a refund request, AWS will process and issue the approved refund.
How do I know that data I subscribe to is free of any malware?
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. To promote a safe, secure, and trustworthy service for everyone, AWS Data Exchange scans data published by providers before making it available to subscribers. If AWS detects malware, AWS will remove the affected file(s). AWS Data Exchange does not guarantee that the data you consume as a subscriber is free of any potential malware. Customers are encouraged to conduct their own additional due-diligence to ensure compliance with their internal security controls. You can explore many third-party anti-malware and security products in AWS Marketplace.
How do I remain compliant with applicable data privacy laws when subscribing to AWS Data Exchange products?
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility among AWS, the data provider, and the subscriber. Detailed restrictions around eligible data sets and other related legal compliance matters are set forth in Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Providers which every data provider must agree to before listing any data products. If AWS learns that these terms are breached in any way, AWS will remove such content from AWS Data Exchange and the data provider may be suspended from the service.
Providers and subscribers are responsible for conducting their own additional due-diligence to ensure compliance with any data privacy laws. If you suspect that a data product or AWS Data Exchange resources are being used for abusive or illegal purposes, you can report it using AWS’s abuse report form.
Are there are any restrictions for how AWS Data Exchange and any data obtained through AWS Data Exchange can be used?
Yes, AWS explicitly prohibits the use of AWS Data Exchange for any illegal or fraudulent activities. Data may not be used for any activities that result in the violation of an individual’s rights or unlawfully discriminate against others based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other related groups. Subscribers may not use any content obtained through AWS Data Exchange that was anonymized and/or aggregated (such that it is no longer associated with an identifiable individual) by the data provider to create, generate, or infer any information relating to a person’s identity (e.g. attempting to triangulate with other data sources).
How do I report abusive content and/or request information be removed from a product suspected of abuse?
If you suspect that a data product or AWS Data Exchange resources are being used for abusive or illegal purposes, you can report it using AWS’s abuse report form and we will investigate. If AWS learns that our terms are breached in any way, AWS may remove the subscriber’s access to the data product and the data provider or the subscriber may be suspended or terminated from future use of AWS Data Exchange
I currently consume third-party data directly into my S3 bucket(s). Why should I consider using AWS Data Exchange to consume data from third parties instead?
AWS Data Exchange centralizes, simplifies, and accelerates your data acquisition process.
AWS Data Exchange allows you to consolidate your ingestion across data providers and receive your data using a single API. You can easily subscribe to new data products, and migrate any existing data feeds through our “Bring Your Own Subscription” feature.
AWS Data Exchange sends you a CloudWatch event as new data is published allowing you to automate ingestion, and stores copies of data you've licensed allowing you to access point-in-time history all in one secure location.
Data Exchange also centralizes your billing so you can receive one invoice from AWS instead of one for each data provider. With the Data Exchange management console, you can easily track your subscriptions in one place, and better manage your data pipeline.
How do I pay for my data product subscriptions?
When you purchase a data product on AWS Data Exchange, you will receive an invoice from Amazon Web Services (AWS) immediately. You can see a breakout of charges for each data product by name in the Detail section of the invoice. You will receive separate bills for usage of AWS infrastructure and analytics services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Athena. You can read more about AWS Billing and Cost Management here.
Provider
How do I qualify to become a data provider on AWS Data Exchange?
To become a data provider on AWS Data Exchange, data providers must agree to the Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Providers (“AWS Marketplace Terms & Conditions”). Data providers must use a valid legal entity domiciled in the United States or a member state of the EU, supply valid banking and taxation identification, and be qualified by the AWS Data Exchange business operations team. Each data provider will also undergo a detailed review by the AWS Data Exchange team prior to being granted permission to list data products on the catalog.
How is data organized in AWS Data Exchange?
Data in AWS Data Exchange is organized using three building blocks – data sets, revisions, and assets. A data set is container for data that belongs together (e.g. end of data pricing for equities trading in the U.S.). Data sets contain a series of revisions, which data providers publish as needed to make new assets available. Revisions can represent changes or new data (e.g. today’s end of day prices), corrections to previous revisions, or entirely new snapshots. Assets are any file that can be stored in Amazon S3 (e.g. CSV, parquet, images). For more details, see Working with Data Sets. Using these building blocks, you can organize the data any way you choose, whether hierarchically to build complex data models or as single data files.
After I create data sets, how do I publish and make them available to my subscribers?
Data sets are made available to subscribers as part of a product. A product is a collection of one or more data sets, metadata that makes the product discoverable in the AWS Data Exchange catalog, pricing, and a Data Subscription Agreement that subscribers must agree to before subscribing. For more information see Publishing Products.
Can I choose which customers can subscribe to my data?
Yes. You have an option to enable subscription verification on any public product, which will require prospective subscribers to fill out a subscription request form including their identity and intended use-case details before subscribing. For these products, you will have up to 45 days to either approve or decline the subscription request. Please note that public products that include personal data are required to have subscription verification enabled. For more details, see Subscription Verification for Providers.
You can also offer Private Products to specific subscribers by using their AWS Account ID. Private Products can be custom-made from existing products on the public catalog or completely new products only offered to the specific customers of your choosing and not listed on the public catalog.
Do I have to package files in a specific format?
AWS Data Exchange allows you to package files in any file format, though you should consider organizing the file and format in a way that allows subscribers to gain insight from the data in a more convenient manner. Parquet formatted files, for example, will allow subscribers to instantly run ad-hoc queries using Amazon Athena in a cost-effective way. Binary or other proprietary file formats will require the subscriber understands how to parse the information, which AWS recommends explaining in each product description.
Who owns the data I am distributing as a provider through AWS Data Exchange?
You retain ownership of the data you distribute as a data provider on AWS Data Exchange. The AWS Marketplace Terms and Conditions require each data provider to attest that they have the legal right to distribute the data they publish. Subscribers must legally agree to the Data Subscription Agreement specified by the data provider before gaining access to data sets contained in a product, which remains available for both data providers and subscribers. Consistent with Amazon Web Services’ acceptable use policy, AWS Data Exchange may suggest corrective action where there is evidence of abuse, but it is the data provider’s responsibility to enforce and govern the terms of use.
How do I specify the Data Subscription Agreement (DSA)?  AWS Data Exchange provides an optional Data Subscription Agreement (DSA) template that incorporates inputs from multiple AWS customers and data providers. You can choose to use this DSA template, copy and edit it with their own terms and conditions, or specify custom terms by uploading a DSA of their choice. AWS Data Exchange will associate the DSA specified for the product without any further modifications. See Publishing Products for further information.
What ways can I price my data sets?
AWS Data Exchange currently supports subscription-based pricing from 1 to 36-month duration terms.
Is AWS Data Exchange suitable for data providers who want to distribute their data for free?
Yes. Many data providers make their data products available for free for research, scientific, or other non-commercial use cases.
Can I customize pricing or terms for select customers?
Yes. “Private offers” allows you to make public products available to select AWS customers for a custom price, duration, and/or Data Subscription Agreement (DSA). To learn more, see Create Private Offers.
Are there any restrictions on what data can be made available on AWS Data Exchange?
Yes. AWS Data Exchange’s Product Publishing Guidelines and Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Providers restrict certain categories of data. Unless a provider is enrolled in the Extended Provider Program, data products listed on AWS Data Exchange may not include information that can be used to identify any person, except information that is already legally available to the public, such as newspaper articles, open court records, public company filings, or public online profiles. For more information about the Extended Provider Program, please contact AWS Support.
Can I remove a product that I published from the catalog?
Yes. You can un-publish a product at any time. Un-publishing a product ensures that no new subscribers are able to view and subscribe to your product, including auto-renewal cancellation for existing subscribers. You will need to keep data current for any existing subscribers until each subscription expires.
What happens if I need to remove data from AWS Data Exchange? You can remove or change the price or Data Subscription Agreement (DSA) of a product at any time, although existing subscriptions will remain in effect until their next renewal. If a data provider erroneously publishes data, you can open a support case here to have the data un-published.
How do I know who is subscribing to the data I have listed on AWS Data Exchange?
AWS Data Exchange provides daily, weekly, and monthly reports detailing subscription activity.
When/how often will I receive payments?
Data providers will receive a disbursement for subscriptions less fulfillment fees once a month. AWS will disburse all funds that AWS has received from subscribers by that date to the bank account linked to the data provider’s AWS account used at registration.
How will AWS handle collection and remittances of U.S. Sales and Use Tax?
When listing your data sets, you can enable collection and remittance of U.S. Sales and Use tax. Data providers can also configure their tax nexus to account for places where you have a physical presence to direct AWS to collect appropriate taxes. Please review the AWS Marketplace U.S Tax Collection Support Terms and Conditions. For details on sales tax collection in other geographies, see AWS Marketplace Sellers & Tax Collection.
Is Amazon.com or AWS providing customers’ data on AWS Data Exchange?
No. Neither Amazon.com nor AWS are providing customers’ data on AWS Data Exchange.
Can AWS access data products listed on AWS Data Exchange?
AWS is vigilant about our customers’ privacy. Companies listing data products on the AWS Data Exchange own and are able to maintain control over who accesses their content. AWS does not access or use data products except as necessary to provide the AWS Data Exchange service.
I currently publish data directly into my Subscribers S3 bucket(s). Why should I consider using AWS Data Exchange to publish data to third parties instead?
With AWS Data Exchange you can publish data simultaneously to all your customers and spend more time growing your business rather than managing logistics.
AWS Data Exchange allows you to publish data to your customers via an easy-to-use API and console. The data model for AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to manage and publish data through reusable constructs: data sets, revisions, and assets. Once published, these products are available to AWS customers, who can subscribe to these products directly from AWS marketplace. The service automatically grants entitlements to customers who have an active subscription to the product, which means that you don’t have to manually configure and maintain custom permissions to an S3 bucket for each subscription.  Data Exchange automatically sends a CloudWatch notification to all subscribers when new revision(s) are published, which allows subscribers to automate their consumption of new data. When a subscription is no-longer active, AWS Data Exchange revokes that subscribers entitlement to your data.  If your product is already available on AWS Data Exchange, you can simply configure an entitlement to your existing subscribers for no additional cost and without any additional programming work using our Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) offer. For more information on BYOS, click here.
