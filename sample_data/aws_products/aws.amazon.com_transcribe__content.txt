Amazon Transcribe
Automatically convert speech to text
Get Started with Amazon Transcribe
Amazon Transcribe makes it easy for developers to add speech to text capabilities to their applications. Audio data is virtually impossible for computers to search and analyze. Therefore, recorded speech needs to be converted to text before it can be used in applications. Historically, customers had to work with transcription providers that required them to sign expensive contracts and were hard to integrate into their technology stacks to accomplish this task. Many of these providers use outdated technology that does not adapt well to different scenarios, like low-fidelity phone audio common in contact centers, which results in poor accuracy.
Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. Amazon Transcribe can be used to transcribe customer service calls, to automate closed captioning and subtitling, and to generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive. You can use Amazon Transcribe Medical to add medical speech to text capabilities to clinical documentation applications.
Benefits
Create easy-to-read transcriptions
Amazon Transcribe automatically adds speaker diarization, punctuation and formatting so that the output closely matches the quality of manual transcription at a fraction of the time and expense. Speech to text processing can be applied to live audio streams or batch audio content for transcription. Learn more »
Ensure customer privacy
When instructed, Amazon Transcribe can identify and redact sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from the supported language transcripts. This allows contact centers to easily review and share the transcripts for customer experience insight and agent training. Learn more »
Increase accuracy with customized transcriptions
With custom vocabulary lists and custom language models, you can add new words to the base vocabulary or train your own language model to generate more accurate transcriptions for domain-specific words and phrases like product names, technical terminology, or names of individuals. Learn more »
Filter specific words
When needed, Amazon Transcribe enables you to mask or remove words that are profane or unsuitable for your audience from transcription results with vocabulary filtering. Learn more »
Use Cases
Customer experience
Customer contact centers can provide actionable insights to their agents by using Amazon Transcribe to transcribe live customer calls and other AWS services like Amazon Comprehend to extract call intent and sentiment from conversations. These insights can assist agents in real-time and provide supervisors with quality management alerts to create a better customer experience.
Post call analytics
With Amazon Transcribe, contact centers can start unlocking value held within unstructured voice call data. By converting these audio calls into text, Amazon Transcribe can be combined with other AWS services like Amazon Comprehend to build post call analytics applications to identify trends and voice of the customer insights.
Documenting clinical conversations
Medical doctors and practitioners can use Amazon Transcribe Medical to quickly and efficiently digitize physician-patient conversations into text for entry into electronic health record (EHR) systems or analysis. The service is HIPPA compliant and trained to understand medical terminology. With Transcribe Medical, physicians can focus more patient care than documentation.
Captioning & subtitling workflows
Amazon Transcribe can help content producers and media distributors improve reach and accessibility by automatically generating time-stamped subtitles that can be displayed along with the video content. By combining this text with Amazon Translate, you can also easily localize videos.
Cataloging audio archives
You can use Amazon Transcribe to transcribe audio and video assets into fully searchable archives for compliance monitoring and risk management. Convert audio to text and use Amazon Elasticsearch to index and search across your audio/video library.
Digital scribes and court reporters
Amazon Transcribe can be used as a digital scribe to accurately log work meetings or educational lectures and seminars. In a courtroom, Amazon Transcribe can act as a digital court reporter to capture hearings and trials, depositions, sworn statements and other legal proceedings.
