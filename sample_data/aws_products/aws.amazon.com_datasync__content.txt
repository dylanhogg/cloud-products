How it works
Transfer data between on premises and AWS
Transfer data between AWS storage services
AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between on premises and AWS storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS), self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems, and Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems.
AWS DataSync is also used to transfer data between AWS Storage services so you can replicate, archive, or share application data easily.
