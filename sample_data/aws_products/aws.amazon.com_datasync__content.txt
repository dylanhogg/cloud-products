AWS DataSync
Simplify, automate, and accelerate moving data to and from AWS Storage, as well as between AWS Storage services
Get started with AWS DataSync
AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services. You can use DataSync to migrate active datasets to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business continuity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis and processing.
Writing, maintaining, monitoring, and troubleshooting scripts to move large amounts of data can burden your IT operations and slow migration projects. DataSync eliminates or automatically handles this work for you. DataSync provides built-in security capabilities such as encryption of data in-transit, and data integrity verification in-transit and at-rest. It optimizes use of network bandwidth, and automatically recovers from network connectivity failures. In addition, DataSync provides control and monitoring capabilities such as data transfer scheduling and granular visibility into the transfer process through Amazon CloudWatch metrics, logs, and events.
DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

Benefits
Simplify and automate transfers
AWS DataSync makes it easy to move data over the network between on-premises storage and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services. DataSync automates both the management of data transfer processes and the infrastructure required for high-performance, secure data transfer.
Transfer data securely
DataSync provides end-to-end security, including encryption and integrity validation, to ensure your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use. DataSync accesses your AWS Storage using built-in AWS security mechanisms, such as IAM roles. It also supports VPC endpoints, providing you with the option to transfer data without traversing the public internet, further increasing the security of data copied online.
Move data faster
DataSync enables you to transfer data rapidly over the network into AWS. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and a parallel, multi-threaded architecture to accelerate your transfers. This speeds up migrations, recurring data processing workflows for analytics and machine learning, and data protection processes.
Reduce operational costs
You can move data cost-effectively with DataSync’s flat, per-gigabyte pricing. You’ll save on script development, deployment and maintenance costs, and avoid the need for costly commercial transfer tools.

Use cases
Data migration
If you are closing data centers or retiring storage arrays, you can use DataSync to move active datasets rapidly over the network into Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Use DataSync to make an initial copy of your entire dataset, and to schedule subsequent incremental transfers of changing data until the final cut-over to AWS. DataSync preserves metadata between storage systems that have similar metadata structures, enabling a smooth transition of end users and applications to your target AWS Storage service.
Data protection
If you have large Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems, you probably have a lot of files to protect. With DataSync, you can replicate files into any Amazon S3 storage class, selecting the most cost-effective storage class for your needs. You can also send the data to Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server as a standby file system.
Archiving of cold data
If you have large amounts of cold data stored in expensive on-premises storage systems, you can move this data directly to durable and secure long-term storage such as Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive. This will allow you to free up on-premises storage capacity and shut down legacy storage systems.
Data processing for hybrid workloads
If you have on-premises systems generating or using data that needs to move between on premises and AWS for processing, you can use DataSync to speed up your critical hybrid workflows. This includes machine learning in life sciences, video production in media and entertainment, big data analytics in financial services, and seismic research in oil and gas.
