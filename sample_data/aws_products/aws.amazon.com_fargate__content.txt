Deploy and manage your applications, not infrastructure. Fargate removes the operational overhead of scaling, patching, securing, and managing servers.
Monitor your applications via built-in integrations with AWS services like Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights. Gather metrics and logs with third-party tools.
Improve security through workload isolation by design. ECS tasks and EKS pods run in their own dedicated runtime environment.
Only pay for what you use. Fargate scales the compute to closely match your specified resource requirements. With Fargate, there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers.
How it works
AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
Use cases
Web applications, APIs, and microservices
Build and deploy your applications, APIs, and microservices architectures with the speed and immutability of containers. Fargate removes the need to own, run, and manage the lifecycle of a compute infrastructure so that you can focus on what matters most: your applications.
Run and scale containerized workloads
Use Fargate with Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS to easily run and scale your containerized data processing workloads.
Support AI and ML training applications
Create an AI and ML development environment that is flexible and portable. With Fargate, achieve the scalability you need to boost server capacity without over-provisioning— to train, test, and deploy your machine learning (ML) models.
